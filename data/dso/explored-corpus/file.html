(March 2009)
In 1991, Nurjamin returned to Cianjur for one week, before going to Malaysia , where he met the two co-founders of JI, Abdullah Sungkar and Abubakar Bashir . The three lived in a housing compound in Kampung Sungai Manggis, Banting , Selangor . Nurjaman internationalized the terrorist group's activities and took on a new name in his permanent residence permit: Riduan Isamuddin. His nickname, Hambali, is an allusion to Hanbali , an Islamic school of jurisprudence.
The two co-founders sent their students to "study" in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The students actually fought the Soviets until the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan. A woman named Noralwizah Lee Abdullah had gone to Malaysia for religious schooling. She secretly married Isamuddin after meeting him at the Luqmanul Hakiem School in Ulu Tiram , Johor . The school was founded by Sungkar and Bashir.
Initially, Isamuddin struggled to make a living for his family. He switched from selling kebabs to patenting medicines. He soon disappeared from his home for weeks at a time, and he received many visitors at home. He eventually came to own a red hatchback and several cell phones. Investigators say that many calls on those cell phones were made to Mohammed Jamal Khalifa , Osama bin Laden's brother in law, who had arrived back in Manila , Philippines in 1991.
After Arab visitors gave his family lots of money, he founded a shell company , Konsojaya , in June 1994. Ostensibly an import-export company trading in palm oil between Malaysia and Afghanistan , it was essentially a front company for terrorism.[ citation needed ] Wali Khan Amin Shah , who would become the financier of Operation Bojinka , was a director of Konsojaya. The company provided financial assistance to the project until it was discovered by investigators on a laptop computer after an apartment fire on January 6, 1995. Shah was arrested in the Philippines but escaped on a short order. Shah was arrested in Malaysia in December 1995. Both Shah and mastermind Ramzi Yousef , who escaped the Philippines but was arrested in Lahore , Pakistan , were extradited to the United States . They were both convicted and sentenced to life in prison for participating in the project.
Hambali goes underground[ edit ]
Hambali's company attracted attention of investigators so his dealings went quiet for a while.[ citation needed ] He decided to preach, raise money, and recruit for his cause. He went underground in 2000 and started a wave of church-bombings in Indonesia. He always had a "hands-on" technique; he met his foot soldiers and came to them "with detailed plans, plenty of cash and two of his own bombmakers." He always fled before the bombing commenced. Meanwhile, the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah, Abu Bakr Bashir , was preaching jihad at his schools while denying links to Islamic militants.[ citation needed ]
Hambali planned and attended the January 2000 Al Qaeda Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . Among the others present were two September 11 hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi . This gathering in Kuala Lumpur was observed by the CIA and Malaysian authorities, but what specifically was being said at the meetings was not picked up. Hambali also provided money and documents to Zacarias Moussaoui in October of that year.
After the Bali nightclub bombing , in which 202 people were killed, Hambali received more attention from the United States. In the years leading up to the attack, the Indonesian government's action against Islamic militants had been minimal. Following the attack, Abu Bakr Bashir was arrested as part of a crack down on Jemaah Islamiah. He was wanted in Indonesia [10] for the bombings of several churches in the region, and wanted for the Bali bombing and a failed plot on several targets in Singapore.
Hambali used a series of safe-houses throughout Southeast Asia , especially Thailand and Cambodia , to move around. While he was in Ayutthaya , Thailand , 75 kilometers north of Bangkok , he was planning a terrorist attack against several Thai hotels and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit (APEC) in Bangkok on October 2003. Hambali had used a false Spanish passport to enter Thailand while his wife used her Malaysian passport.
Thai police found him as part of a joint operation between the Thai police and the CIA on August 11, 2003. The twenty uniformed and undercover police smashed down the door to his one bedroom apartment in Ayutthaya, and arrested him and 33-year-old Noralwizah Lee Abdullah, a Chinese Malaysian who was considered to be his wife. Hambali was wearing a pair of jeans, a t-shirt, a baseball cap, and a pair of sunglasses. Police also seized explosives and firearms in the property. It marked the end of a 20-month hunt for Hambali, who was 37 years of age when he was captured.
A 2006 Human Rights Watch report stated that Hambali was imprisoned in Jordan for the account of the CIA .[ citation needed ] On September 6, 2006, President George W. Bush confirmed that Hambali had been held by the CIA and revealed that he had been transferred to Guantanamo Bay . [11] His wife is now in Malaysian custody.
On September 8, 2006 Indonesia formally requested access to Hambali to ensure a fair trial . [12] The United States are reluctant to hand him over because of the lenient sentence Indonesia imposed on Bashir.[ citation needed ]
Hambali is also wanted in the Philippines for the transfer of explosives on Filipino soil in an attempt to transport them to Singapore .
Following his capture the USA would not confirm or deny that he was in their custody. But on September 6, 2006, President Bush acknowledged [13] the existence of covert, overseas CIA interrogation centres (colloquially known as black sites ) and announced that 14 high-profile members al Qaeda and related groups had been transported from those sites to Guantanamo Bay. [14] Those 14 include Hambali and an alleged lieutenant of his called Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep alias Lillie or Li-Li.
Combatant Status Review[ edit ]
the protections of the Geneva Conventions did not extend to captured prisoners who are not members of the regular Afghan armed force nor meet the criteria for prisoner of war for voluntary forces. [15]
Critics argued the Conventions obliged the U.S. to conduct competent tribunals to determine the status of prisoners. Subsequently, the U.S. Department of Defense instituted Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs), to determine whether detainees met the new definition of an " enemy combatant ".
"Enemy combatant" was defined by the U.S. Department of Defense as:
an individual who was part of, or supporting, the Taliban, or al-Qaeda forces, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. This includes any person who commits a belligerent act or has directly supported hostilities in aid of enemy armed forces. [16]
The CSRTs are not bound by the rules of evidence that would normally apply in civilian court, and the government’s evidence is presumed to be “genuine and accurate.” [17] From July 2004 through March 2005, CSRTs were convened to determine whether each prisoner had been correctly classified as an "enemy combatant".
Riduan Isamuddin was among the 60% of prisoners who chose to participate in tribunal hearings. [18] A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for the tribunal of each detainee, listing the allegations that supported their detention as an "enemy combatant".
Riduan Isamuddin's memo accused him of the following: [19]
The Department of Defense announced on August 9, 2007 that all fourteen of the "high-value detainees" who had been transferred to Guantanamo from the CIA's black sites , had been officially classified as "enemy combatants". [20] Although judges Peter Brownback and Keith J. Allred had ruled two months earlier that only "illegal enemy combatants" could face military commissions, the Department of Defense waived the qualifier and said that all fourteen men could now face charges before Guantanamo military commissions . [21] [22]
Possible transfer to Washington DC for a civilian trial[ edit ]
According to Xinhua the Obama Presidency is considering transferring Riduan Isamuddin to Washington DC for a civilian trial. [23]
Some of the above information about Hambali, and more, can be read in the report [8] of the 9-11 Commission.

Analysis
Riduan Isamuddin (also known as Hambali) is an Indonesian citizen who was captured in August 2003 in Ayuttaya, a Thai city 50 miles to the north of Bangkok, by a joint force of Thai and US security forces. The US Government accuses Hambali of being the operational commander of Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and a lead member of al-Qaeda responsible for multiple bombings in Southeast Asia, including the Bali bombings of October 2002 which killed over 200 people. He has been classified as a ‘High-Value Detainee’ (HVD), and was held for over three years in secret detention before being transferred to Guantánamo Bay in September 2006, where he remains.
Hambali was captured in a joint Thai-CIA operation in Ayuttaya on 11 August 2003, several hours after his associate, Lillie , was captured in Bangkok. He was initially held in US custody in a secret location in Thailand for 3-4 days, during which time he has testified that he was made to stand in a stress position with his hands cuffed to a hook in the ceiling, and kept naked, blindfolded and with a sack over his head.
Hambali’s continued secret detention in Afghanistan was confirmed in September 2003 by a senior Asian intelligence officer ‘with access to key interrogation records’ . This official stated that he was being held and interrogated at Bagram Airbase, alongside Zubair and Lillie . Hambali has testified that he was kept naked for most of the first six weeks of his detention in Afghanistan. Clothes were provided during the second week, but then removed again. He has also said that he was beaten repeatedly, with his interrogators placing a thick collar around his neck and then slamming him against walls.
The fate and whereabouts of Hambali after the initial six weeks of his detention in Afghanistan is unclear. Indeed, the only fact which has been made public regarding Hambali’s treatment after Afghanistan comes from his testimony to the International Committee of the Red Cross, where he states that in his third place of detention ‘he was threatened with a return to previous methods of ill-treatment (namely, having his head slammed against the wall by use of a collar), by his interrogators showing him the collar during interrogation sessions’.
Some reports have suggested that Hambali was held on the British island territory of Diego Garcia at some point after his capture, with Time magazine running a story in October 2003 which cited a ‘regional intelligence official’ to this effect. Indeed, the Council of Europe’s Rapporteur investigating European complicity in US renditions and secret detention – Dick Marty – claimed in his 2007 final report that ‘we have received concurring confirmations that United States agencies have used the island territory of Diego Garcia... in the “processing” of high-value detainees’. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Novak, also claimed in 2008 that he had ‘received credible evidence from well-placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on Diego Garcia between 2002 and 2003’. However, neither Marty nor Novak named any detainees in particular, and there is little in the way of concrete evidence to suggest that Hambali was among those who may have been detained on the island. In particular, the Time story is based largely on records obtained of Hambali’s interrogations on 22 and 26 August, and it is likely that these were in fact from his detention in Afghanistan.
Hambali has also been cited by the Associated Press’ Adam Goldman as having been detained in Morocco and then Romania during 2004 and 2005, although again there is little in the way of detailed evidence in the public domain to support such assertions. Click here for further analysis of where the HVDs – including Hambali – may have been held during 2005-2006 .
On 4 September 2006, Hambali was transferred along with 13 other HVDs out of the CIA’s secret prison network and into US military detention in Guantánamo Bay. This final transfer was announced by President Bush two days later , as part of a wider disclosure about the CIA’s use of secret prisons.
Hambali remains detained in Guantánamo Bay.

As they struggled from the wreckage, poor Muslim congregations came to depend on foreign charities for help rebuilding their mosques, whose numbers have risen tenfold to around 250 today, says Bjorn Blengsi, an anthropologist. They also became receptive to imported versions of Islam, which tend to be stricter than the traditionally relaxed local variety. Agnès de Féo, another anthropologist and author of “ L’Islam au Cambodge et au Vietnam” says both Wahhabism from Saudi Arabia and Tablighi Jemaat from India are gaining adherents.
Nothing wrong with that, perhaps. Most Islamic charities teach the faith and help the poor. But not, alas, all. In one much-publicised incident in 2002, according to the American government, a local member of the Kuwaiti-based Revival of Islamic Heritage Society (RIHS) helped an Indonesian fugitive, Riduan Isamuddin (alias Hambali), the mastermind behind the nightclub bombings in Bali. Hambali, who is now in prison in Guantánamo Ba y, reportedly said he had hoped to bomb the American and British embassies in Phnom Penh and to use Cambodia as a base for terrorist operations throughout South-East Asia. RIHS, which has been cleared of links with terrorism by Kuwait’s government, remains active in Cambodia. A local affiliate, the Kuwait-Cambodia Islamic Cultural Training Centre, recently met the president of parliament.
T he influence of foreign religious organisations seems to be growing along with rising government loans from Gulf states. These loans include help for rebuilding religious institutions. In January, for example, Cambodia approved an agreement with Kuwait from 2008 in which the oil-rich state promised loans of $546m, mostly for energy and agriculture, and including $5m for new mosques and madrassas (Islamic schools). The only unusual thing about this was that the religious component was revealed. According to Milton Osborne of the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank, most aid packages from the Gulf include such a component but do not make it public.

<h1>JEMAAH ISLAMIYAH (JI) STILL WORKING WITH MILF </h1>
JEMAAH ISLAMIYAH (JI) STILL WORKING WITH MILF
MANILA, OCTOBER 7, 2003 (STAR) Indonesian terror chief Riduan Isamuddin, alias Hambali, confirmed to US investigators that there are definite links between the terror groups al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), Time magazine reported.
According to this week�s issue of Time, Hambali told his American interrogators that some $27,000 (about P1.5 million) from the al-Qaeda fund was transferred to the MILF sometime between July and August.
The Time exclusive was the most detailed confirmation yet of US Ambassador Francis Ricciardone�s claim that the JI has set up terrorist cells in Mindanao, threatening the pledged $30-million US development aid to MILF areas if it maintains ties with terrorists and outlaws.
But the MILF continued to deny the charge, with MILF vice chairman Ghadzali Jaafar saying "all maneuvers are being done to pressure us."
According to the report on Hambali�s interrogation, a copy of which Time obtained, al-Qaeda also sent money to fund future attacks on targets such as the US and British embassies in Bangkok, nightclubs in Thailand and shopping malls in Makati City.
Hambali himself scouted the Israeli embassy and a synagogue, also in Makati City, according to the interrogation report, because "Jewish targets were always the main priority."
Hambali also confirmed suspicions that JI members train in MILF camps and that it is "most likely (that) a large number of members of JI Indonesia are hiding in the Philippines and supporting the MILF."
According to the interrogation report, Hambali said al-Qaeda sent him $30,000 to finance the bombing of two nightclubs in Bali that left 202 people dead.
"Al-Qaeda was highly satisfied with the Bali bombing and as a result provided additional money" totaling $100,000, an interrogation report said.
From that money, $45,000 was given to JI in Indonesia, Hambali said. Another $15,000 was to support the families of the imprisoned Bali bombers and $30,000 was to finance new attacks.
Hambali said some of the money could have been used for the August bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, where 12 people were killed, the magazine said.
Hambali, who was captured in Thailand on Aug. 11, is under interrogation at the US-British air base in the British island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.
Hambali is believed to be al-Qaeda�s Asian pointman and JI operations chief.
"Of course, Hambali, 39, may be lying about at least some of it," wrote Time�s Southeast Asian correspondent Simon Elegant from Kuala Lumpur. Prefaces to summaries of Hambali�s questioning warn he may be practicing "counter-interrogation techniques."
But two of his closest aides, Bashir bin Lap, alias Lillie, and Mohammed Farik bin Amin corroborated much of what Hambali said.
Hambali claims JI has been virtually "destroyed... because of those who had been captured." US: MILF Must Cut Terror Links
But, on Oct. 1, Ricciardone said the JI is known to have set up terrorist cells in MILF-controlled areas in Mindanao.
"The US will not provide economic development assistance in areas controlled by the MILF if that organization maintains ties to outlaws, terrorists, in violation of the written testimony of (deceased MILF) chairman (Hashim) Salamat in his last days," the envoy said last week.
Before his death in July, Salamat wrote a letter to US President George W. Bush expressing the MILF�s commitment to peacefully resolve their 35-year rebellion, Ricciardone said.
Ricciardone said Washington was "particularly concerned about the continuing presence in Mindanao of JI, which has been blamed for the October (2002) bombing in Bali, Indonesia that left more than 200 people dead."
However, the MILF�s Jaafar said in an interview with a Cotabato City radio station that Ricciardone�s pronouncement was only meant to "intimidate" the MILF and "pressure it to accelerate its forging of a final peace pact with the government."
Peace negotiations between the government and the MILF have been revived under the auspices of the Malaysian government and talks are set to restart in Kuala Lumpur sometime this month.
"There can be no other way we can interpret the circulation of these recycled stories ... that the MILF has links with al-Qaeda and the Jemaah Islamiyah," Jaafar told Catholic radio station dxMS.
Jaafar said Salamat, who died on July 13, was not the only one to disavow any link to terrorist organizations.
MILF chairman Ebrahim Murad, who succeeded Salamat, also issued a statement announcing that the MILF central committee has rejected terrorism.
"We will welcome an investigation on our alleged links with the Jemaah Islamiyah and al-Qaeda. Surely, investigators will find nothing," Jaafar said. - Time Asia, AFP, John Unson

<h1>Hambali - 911myths US Government biography NAME Hambali . PHONETICS HAM-bali KEY ALIAS(ES) Riduan bin Isomuddin (true name), Encep Nurjaman AFFILIATION Jemaah Islamiya and al-Qa </h1>
AFFILIATION Jemaah Islamiya and al-Qa'ida
NATIONALITY Born in Indonesia, ethnically Sudanese
Indonesian-born Riduan bin Isomuddin -- best known among extremists as Hambali -- was an operational mastermind in the Southeast Asia-based Islamic extremist group Jemaah Islamiya (JI) and also served as the main interface between JI and al-Qa'ida from 2000 until his capture in 2003. Hambali helped plan the first Bali bombings in 2002 that killed more than 200 persons and facilitated al-Qa'ida financing for the Jakarta Marriott Hotel bombing the following year. In late 2002, he also directed his subordinates Lillie and Zubair to case the British High Commission in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Hambali was previously involved in the attempted assassination of the Philippine Ambassador to Indonesia in August 2000 and the bombings on Christmas Eve that year of some 30 churches across the archipelago. Hambali had longstanding ties to al-Qa'ida external operations chief Khalid Shaykh Muhammad (KSM). Before returning to Southeast Asia in December 2001, Hambali discussed operations with senior al-Qa'ida leaders regarding post-11 September attacks against US interests.
Hambali in 1999 established a cell of young JI operatives in Karachi, Pakistan -- dubbed al-Ghuraba -- which provided its members with advanced doctrinal and operational training, including at al-Qa'ida training camps in Afghanistan. Hambali tapped his younger brother, Rusman "Gun Gun" Gunawan, as deputy Ghuraba cell leader.
Hambali was born on 4 April 1964 in Cianjur, West Java, and is the eldest male of 11 children. His great-grandfather founded a local Islamic school, which Hambali attended during his early adolescence. Hambali was a devout Muslim youth who, at age 20, left Indonesia for Malaysia. ostensibly to seek work. While there, he met JI co-founder Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Bashir -- fellow Indonesians who had fled the Suharto regime for Malaysia -- and through them was exposed to radical Islamic teachings. Hambali tried unsuccessfully to get a scholarship to an Islamic school in Malaysia, before traveling in the mid-1980s to Afghanistan, where he fought alongside many of al-Qa'ida's future leaders. During his three-year stint in Afghanistan, he forged strong ties to Usama Bin Ladin and KSM. After returning to Malaysia in the early I 990s, Hambali and JI spiritual leader Bashir further developed their relationship and became close friends.

Riduan Isamuddin also transliterated as Riduan Isamudin, Riduan Isomuddin, and Riduan Isomudin, better known by the nom de guerre Hambali, born as Encep Nurjaman (born April 4, 1964) is the former military leader of the Indonesian terrorist organization Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), which is linked with Al Qaeda . He is now in extrajudicial detention in the United States 's Guantanamo Bay detainment camps , in Cuba .
Hambali was often described as "the Osama bin Laden of Southeast Asia ". Some media reports describe him as Bin Laden's lieutenant for Southeast Asian operations. Other reports describe him as an independent peer. He was highly trusted by Al Qaeda and was the main link between the two organisations. Hambali was a close friend of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , who planned Operation Bojinka and the September 11 Terrorist Attacks . Hambali envisioned creating a Muslim state, in the form of an Islamic superpower (a theocracy ) across Southeast Asia , with himself as its leader ( Caliph ). His ambition was to rule Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , Brunei and parts of the Philippines , Myanmar , and Thailand
He received increasing attention in the aftermath of the 2002 Bali nightclub bombing , in which 202 people died. According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence he served as the third in command of Al Qaeda, from the 2003 capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to his own capture in 2005. He was eventually apprehended in a joint operation by the CIA and Thai police. He is currently imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba, after three years of CIA custody in a secret location.

Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing
Location
‡ indicates attacks resulting in over 100 deaths
Red indicates the deadliest terrorist attack/s to date
The Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing occurred during the night of 20 September 2008, when a dump truck filled with explosives detonated in front of the Marriott Hotel in the Pakistani capital Islamabad , killing at least 54 people, injuring at least 266 and leaving a 60 ft (20 m) wide, 20 ft (6 m) deep crater outside the hotel. [4] The majority of the casualties were Pakistanis ; although at least five foreign nationals were killed and fifteen others reported injured. The attack occurred mere hours after President Asif Ali Zardari made his first speech to the Pakistani parliament . [5] The Marriott hotel was the most prestigious hotel in the capital, located near government buildings , diplomatic missions , embassies and high commissions . [6]
During the investigation, three suspected terrorists were arrested by the Pakistani police. They were suspected of having facilitated the suicide bomber. However later they were acquitted of all charges as no evidence was ever presented against them.
A few months after its bombing, the Government of Pakistan had re-constructed the hotel and the Islamabad Marriott reopened officially on 28 December 2008. [7]

The hotel blast caused a severe natural gas leak that set the top floor of the five-story, 258-room hotel on fire, police said. The explosion was heard 15 kilometres away. [8] The blaze that followed quickly engulfed the entire structure of the Marriott hotel. [9] About two-thirds of the building caught fire as a result of the explosion after a natural gas pipe was blown open, and the reception area was completely destroyed. [6] [9] [10] [11] [12]
The owner of the Marriott Hotel, Hashoo Group , [13] owned by Sadruddin Hashwani , who is an Ismaili Muslim , [14] [15] said the truck carrying the bomb had been stopped at the front barrier. "Some shots were fired. One of our guards fired back, and in the meantime the suicide bomber detonated all the explosives. All the guards on the gate died", said Hashwani. [16]
Most of the dead were Pakistani citizens, but foreigners also died from other countries. Two American military personnel [17] and a Danish intelligence agent [18] were killed, and a U.S. State Department employee was missing and presumed dead. [19] The Czech ambassador to Pakistan, Dr. Ivo Žďárek , also died in the ensuing fire along with his Vietnamese companion. Although Žďárek had survived the initial blast, he returned to the hotel to help in the rescue effort but was trapped in the burning building. [20] [21] In addition, six Germans , four Britons and a Filipina receptionist from the hotel [22] were among the injured. [23]
Meeting of the Pakistani leadership[ edit ]
Pakistan's top leaders were to have been in the Islamabad Marriott hotel when it was bombed; instead, having changed their plans at the last minute, they gathered for dinner at the Prime Minister 's house, a few hundred yards from the explosion, following President Asif Ali Zardari maiden address to a joint session of parliament. [24] "The national assembly speaker had arranged a dinner for the entire leadership – for the president, prime minister and armed services chiefs – at the Marriott that day", the Interior ministry head, Rehman Malik, told reporters. [25]
However, the hotel owner, Sadruddin Hashwani, denied that such a meeting had ever been scheduled to take place. [26] According to a spokesman for Hashwani, "We didn't have any reservation for such a dinner that the government official is talking about." [27]
Government advisor Rehman Malik said RDX and TNT were used in the attack. [30] Approximately 600 kg (1,300 lb) of RDX was mixed with TNT ( Torpex or H6 ) and a mixture of mortar and ammunition to increase the explosive capacity. Aluminum powder was also mixed with the material to further enhance this capability. Torpex is about fifty percent more powerful than TNT by weight. [31] The blast was heard for many miles throughout the capital.
"Delay switches" might also have been used. [32] Guards were first alerted by a minor blast, which was followed by the much larger explosion about four minutes later. [26]
Video of the attack[ edit ]
CCTV footage of a six-wheeled dumper truck enters the gates of the Marriott hotel.
The Pakistani government released the CCTV footage of the attack at a press conference saying that a six-wheeled dumper truck filled with explosives and an accelerant pulled up at the gate and first caught fire before exploding a few minutes later. [33] [34]
An unnamed senior security official stated that about 30 U.S. Marines , scheduled to go to Afghanistan , were staying at the hotel, and they were believed to be the targets of the bombing. This conflicted with information given by another unnamed official who stated that the Marines were in Pakistan in connection with the visit by U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen who met the Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani and other government officials on Wednesday [35] The personnel were staying on the fourth floor of the hotel, which was also among the most severely damaged by the fire which ensued following the bomb blast. [36] According to the Dawn , a number of the marines who stayed at the hotel sustained injuries; the newspaper also cited an unnamed law enforcement official stating "personnel of a U.S. security agency" were in all likelihood target of the attack. [37] There are also reports that more Americans were present at the hotel, as several senior CIA officers were visiting Islamabad at the time of the attack and believed to be staying at the hotel, according to unnamed "well placed sources". A 29 May 2009 press release from NSA reads: CTM3 Matthew J. O'Bryant, USN, a Navy Cryptologist, was assigned to Navy Information Operations Command (NIOC) Maryland. CTM3 O'Bryant made the ultimate sacrifice on 20 September 2008 while performing a cryptologic mission in Pakistan. The hotel has a direct line of sight to the telecom system in Islamabad Pakistan. [38] The other American soldier killed was Major Rodolfo Ivan Rodriguez, USAF. Major Rodriguez was doing work for the US Embassy and staying at the Marriott at the time of the attack.
Claims of American soldiers breaching security[ edit ]
An MP for the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party , Syed Mumtaz Alam Gillani , has come forward with testimony evidencing a purportedly serious security breach at the Marriott on the night between 16 and 17 September, several days before the bombing. [39] [40] [41] [42] Alam Gillani and two friends are said to have witnessed several large steel boxes being unloaded from a U.S. Embassy truck by a group of U.S. Marines and, according to someone at the hotel, transported to the fourth and fifth floors. [39] [40] Among the several people who witnessed this incident was Pakistan Peoples Party leader Sajjad Chaudhry. [39] However, Alam Gilani was the only one who objected to and protested the apparent security breach taking place, but was met with silence from the American Marines. The hotel security staff did not respond to Alam Gilani's protests as they passively watched what was taking place, not being allowed to go near the boxes by the U.S. Marines. [39] [40] Alam Gillani has since denounced the newspaper account, asserting that he was merely making light conversation with the journalist, however, the newspaper stands by its account. [43] Pakistani authorities are also investigating this issue. [41]
The American Embassy has said that it routinely rents rooms at the Marriott. Confronted with the activities of the U.S. Marines on the night between 16 and 17 September, embassy spokesperson Lou Fintor stated: "A team of support personnel often and routinely precede and/or accompany certain U.S. government officials. They often carry communication and office equipment required to support large delegations, such as high-level administration officials and members of the U.S. Congress." However, the incident occurred after Admiral Mullen's departure. [41]
President Asif Ali Zardari was considering delaying his visit to the US to attend the UN General Assembly session in the wake of the bombing. MP Ayaz Amir said that he felt that the president should cancel his visit given the circumstances, and instead should combat terrorism and extremism. He added, "I believe that the UN General Assembly annual session is the most useless event in the world where leaders go to listen their own speeches." [44] However, Zardari did make it to New York for the opening of the new session of the General Assembly.
Due to the attack, British Airways suspended flights to Islamabad as a precautionary measure "until further notice." [45] American schools and universities in Islamabad has closed rest of the week until further notice has reached.
The BBC reported that Pakistan was an important ally of the United States in its " war on terror ", but that it had disagreements over tactics and had complained about US raids from Afghanistan . [6] Following an apparent power vacuum as a result of the stepping down of former president Pervez Musharraf earlier in the month, U.S. missile-strikes had increased, culminating in the Baghar Cheena airstrike on 17 September. [46] After the event, president Asif Ali Zardari appealed for "all democratic forces" to help to save Pakistan and he pledged to rid Pakistan of Islamic militants: "Terrorism is a cancer in Pakistan, we are determined, God willing , we will rid the country of this cancer. I promise you that such actions by these cowards will not lower our resolve." [6] Pakistan's chief adviser on internal security, Rehman Malik , said "the authorities would fight on until the last terrorist is cleared. We think that the safe Pakistan, safe Afghanistan is safety for the world and therefore we will not let them have easy way." [6]
A Taliban spokesperson denied the group's involvement in the blast, saying they "do not believe in killing so many locals." [47]
An American intelligence official stated that the attack "bears all the hallmarks of a terrorist operation carried out by Al Qaeda or its associates." [12] [28]
Some investigators suspect another Islamist group, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami , is responsible for the attack based upon the similarities between this incident and four previous attacks allegedly conducted by its operatives. [48]
Dubai -based Arabiya Television says a group calling itself Fedayeen Islam [49] [50] (also spelled Fedayan-i-Islam [51] ), variously translated as "Islamic Commandos" [49] or "Islamic Patriots" [50] has called Arabiya's correspondent in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. The correspondent said he received a text message on his mobile phone showing a telephone number. He said he called the number and then heard a recording in which the group admitted launching Saturday's attack. The Arabiya television correspondent says the speaker spoke in English language with a South Asian accent. The Fedayeen Islam group has issued several demands including for Pakistan to stop its cooperation with the United States. [50]
Usama al-Kini , one of the suspects who were involved in the hotel attacks.
On 1 January 2009 a missile fired from an unmanned aerial vehicle killed al-Qaeda 's Pakistan operations chief, Usama al-Kini and his aide Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan . U.S. officials stated that they believed that al-Kini masterminded the hotel bombing, among other attacks such as the 1998 embassy attacks in East Africa. [52]
The "Islamabad Marriott Assistance Fund" was started by the owner of the hotel as the blast and resulting fires killed about 40 hotel staff, including the security guards who had tried to avert the disaster, while scores of other employees were also wounded.
Sadruddin Hashwani said: "We have set up a fund to cater for the future expenses of the families of employees either killed or wounded in the attack." He announced that he would make an initial donation of US$ 126,000 to the fund, and appealed for people to donate generously. [53]
The Marriott International and The J. Willard and Alice S. Marriott Foundation also made contributions to the fund, established through United Way to provide financial assistance to the associates and their families affected by the tragedy. [54]
A panel that the government had formed, consisting of police officials and experts from security agencies to probe the attack, presented a preliminary report to the Prime Minister. The Interior Secretary Syed Kamal Shah also admitted to the Senate's Standing Committee on his ministry that the blast was the result of a defective security system. He added that the Islamabad police chief has said intelligence agencies had informed the police about an explosive-laden vehicle entering the city to carry out an attack. [24]
Three suspected terrorists Mohammed Aqeel (possibly Dr. Usman), Rana Ilyas and Hameed Afzal were arrested in Peshawar on 17 October by the Pakistani police with connection to the attack were remanded to police custody for 7 days on 18 October for questioning by an anti-terrorism court. They were suspected of having facilitated the suicide bomber. In requesting the court for a 10-day remand, the police also said they hoped to arrest more suspects with information from the three. Judge Sakhi Muhammad Kahut, who remanded the trio to police custody, also ordered police to produce them in court again on 24 October.
Police said that Qari Ishtiaq, who is said to be the commander of Punjabi Tehrik-i-Taliban, was arrested from Bahawalpur on the information provided by the Hijratullah who has been jailed for 10 years due to his role in Lahore police academy attacks . [55] Seven other militants were arrested from different parts of Punjab regions. Four hundred kilograms (880 lb) of explosives were also seized from Qari Ishtiaq. [56]
On 5 May 2010, Mohammed Aqeel , Rana Ilyas, Muhammad Hamid Afzal and Tahseen Ullah were acquitted of all charges as no evidence was ever presented against them. [57]
Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka said, "Clearly, the attacks were not meant for the Kenyan embassy and our citizens are out of danger." He also sent messages of condolences to the people of the country on behalf of his government.
The attack that left the Kenyan embassy in Islamabad damaged. The Permanent Secretary in the Foreign Affairs ministry Mwangi Thuita confirmed the incidence. The blast only shattered windows and doors of the embassy. [81]

Hotels in Boston and to a lesser extent, New York and Washington, D.C., have tightened security in the wake of the bombing attacks near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.
Some are restricting access to guests, others are encouraging guests to stay indoors per police department instructions and still others have stopped accepting checked luggage.
"Starwood Hotels in Boston, New York and Washington have increased security measures," says Starwood spokesman Trey Sarten.
The most obvious security changes are at hotels near the finish line in Boston.
Authorities ordered the evacuation of the luxury Mandarin Oriental hotel, says chain spokeswoman Danielle Devoe.
"As a precautionary measure, they have ordered the evacuation of the hotel," she says. It was still ongoing as of about 6 p.m. The hotel did not have an update on what will happen next, since the situation "is still unfolding," she says.
At the Sheraton hotel, guest Erin Moore, whose husband Jim completed the marathon before the blasts, says they've been instructed not to leave the hotel.
"We've been told the building's on lockdown and they have armed guards out front," she says. Besides, "we have nowhere to go. Everything within a 15-block radius has been closed anyway, we've been told. There' s no point in wandering."
The lobby, she says, was packed with marathon runners who had nowhere else to go after authorities evacuated the streets following the blasts.
The Fairmont Copley Plaza, located two blocks from the finish line, only guests and workers have been allowed to enter the hotel since the bombings, says spokeswoman Lori Holland. Additionally, people entering the hotel had to have their bags searched by the Boston Police.
And per the instructions of Boston Police, those already inside the hotel were encouraged to stay inside, she says. The hotel transformed its St. James Room bar so that people could get in touch with loved ones.
The Wyndham chain has stepped up security in its hotels in Boston as well as New York, says spokeswoman Christine DaSilva.
"Our general managers have notified their teams to be extra vigilant, to not accept checked luggage, and to bring up and report any suspicious activities," she says.
Other hotels won't identify what steps they're taking.
In a statement, Marriott International says it's monitoring the situation closely and "out of an abundance of precaution, have enhanced security measures at our nearby hotels." The company operates eight Marriott-brand hotels and a Ritz-Carlton in the Boston area.
Hilton Worldwide, also in a statement, says that as a precaution it has "increased our security at hotels in the Boston area as well as other properties as appropriate." Hilton declined to disclose details.
The Loews Boston Back Bay Hotel has "taken the appropriate security measures to keep our guests safe as a precaution in response to today's incident," says Lark-Marie Anton, a spokeswoman for the Loews chain.
Some Times Square hotels tighten security
Some New York hotels — especially those in the usually busy Times Square neighborhood — have been beefing up security, too.
The Times Square area after the Boston bombings saw a "seriously stepped up" police presence, says Robert Snyder, president of Tishman Hotel Corp., which owns the InterContinental and Westin hotels in the popular tourist destination.
The two hotels specifically are checking people's key cards before they're allowed to enter the hotel. They're "admitting only registered guests," Snyder says.
The owner of the Doubletree by Hilton hotel in Times Square also is taking extra precautions.
"We are taking all necessary and appropriate steps to ensure the safety of our guests across our portfolio," says Ken Cruse, CEO of Sunstone Hotel Investors, which owns the hotel as well as the Boston Marriott Long Wharf. He declined to specify the additional steps being taken.
But not all Times Square hotels are changing their security procedures.
The Best Western Plus President Hotel is on 48th Street, within walking distance to Times Square, isn't doing anything different, says spokeswoman Laura Cherry. The same is true at the New York Palace hotel, which is farther away from Times Square, near Madison Avenue and 51st Street, says general manager Simon Mais.
Some hotels, airlines waive canceled-trip penalties
Travelers who had planned to visit Boston but changed their mind in light of the deadly blasts may be able to cancel their trip or leave early without paying a change fee.
At this point, three major hotel companies are waiving fees for canceled or changed trips to Boston.
Hilton Worldwide, which runs Hilton, Doubletree and Hampton Inn chains
Starwood, which oversees the St. Regis, Sheraton and Westin chains
Marriott, which runs chains such as Marriott, Courtyard and SpringHill Suites
IHG, the parent of the Holiday Inn, InterContinental and Staybridge Suites chains
Kimpton, which runs three hotels in Boston including the Nine Zero
Fairmont, which runs the Fairmont Copley Plaza

<h1>2002 Bali bombings - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia </h1>
2002 Bali bombings

Location
Attack type
The 2002 Bali bombings occurred on 12 October 2002 in the tourist district of Kuta on the Indonesian island of Bali . The attack killed 202 people (including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians, 27 Britons, 7 Americans, 6 Swedish citizens and 3 Danish citizens). [3] A further 240 people were injured.
Various members of Jemaah Islamiyah , a violent Islamist group, were convicted in relation to the bombings, including three individuals who were sentenced to death . The attack involved the detonation of three bombs: a backpack-mounted device carried by a suicide bomber ; a large car bomb , both of which were detonated in or near popular nightclubs in Kuta; and a third much smaller device detonated outside the United States consulate in Denpasar , causing only minor damage. An audio-cassette purportedly carrying a recorded voice message from Osama Bin Laden stated that the Bali bombings were in direct retaliation for support of the United States' war on terror and Australia's role in the liberation of East Timor . [4]
On 9 November 2008, Imam Samudra , Amrozi Nurhasyim and Huda bin Abdul Haq were executed by firing squad on the island prison of Nusakambangan at 00:15 local time (17:15 UTC).
On 9 March 2010, Dulmatin, nicknamed "the Genius" – believed to be responsible for setting off one of the Bali bombs with a mobile phone – was killed in a shoot-out with Indonesian police in Jakarta. [5]
Contents
Fatalities by country
At 23:05 Central Indonesian Time (15:05 UTC) on 12 October 2002, a suicide bomber inside the nightclub Paddy's Pub detonated a bomb in his backpack, causing many patrons, with or without injuries, to immediately flee into the street. Twenty seconds later, a second and much more powerful car bomb hidden inside a white Mitsubishi van was detonated by another suicide bomber outside the Sari Club , located opposite Paddy's Pub. The van was also rigged for detonation by remote control in case the second bomber had a sudden change of heart.[ citation needed ] Damage to the densely populated residential and commercial district was immense, destroying neighbouring buildings and shattering windows several blocks away. The car bomb explosion left a one metre deep crater. [6]
The local Sanglah hospital was ill-equipped to deal with the scale of the disaster and was overwhelmed with the number of injured, particularly burn victims. There were so many people injured by the explosion that some of the injured had to be placed in hotel pools near the explosion site to ease the pain of their burns. Many of the injured were forced to be flown extreme distances to Darwin (1100 miles/1800 km) and Perth (1600 miles/2600 km) for specialist burn treatment.
A comparatively small bomb detonated outside the U.S. consulate in Denpasar , which is thought to have exploded shortly before the two Kuta bombs, caused minor injuries to one person and property damage was minimal. It was reportedly packed with human excrement. [7]
A report released on August 2005 by the United States-Indonesia Society (USINDO) described the events as follows: [8]
The investigators were thus able to recreate the bombers activities. Amrozi, Idris and Ali Imron had simply walked into a dealership and purchased a new Yamaha motorbike, after asking how much they could re-sell it for if they returned it in a few days. Imron used the motorbike to plant the small bomb outside the U.S. Consulate. Idris then rode the motorbike as Imron drove two suicide bombers in the Mitsubishi to the nightclub district in Kuta. He stopped near the Sari Club, instructed one suicide bomber to put on his explosives vest and the other to arm the vehicle bomb. The first bomber headed to Paddy's Pub. Idris then left the second bomber, who had only learned to drive in a straight line, to drive the minivan the short distance to the Sari Club. Idris picked up Imron on the Yamaha and the duo headed back into Denpasar. Idris dialed the number of the Nokia to detonate the bomb at the Consulate. The two suicide bombers exploded their devices. Imron and Idris dropped the motorbike at a place where it eventually attracted the attention of the caretaker.
The final death toll was 202, mainly comprising Western tourists and holiday-makers in their 20s and 30s who were in or near Paddy's Pub or the Sari Club, but also including many Balinese Indonesians working or living nearby, or simply passing by. Hundreds more people suffered horrific burns and other injuries. The largest group among those killed were holidayers from Australia with 88 fatalities. On 14 October, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1438 condemning the attack as a threat to international peace and security.
Two bodies were never identified and were cremated at Bali in September 2003.[ citation needed ]
There were many acts of individual heroism.
Kusitino 'Kossy' Halemai, a Wallis and Futuna -born Australian citizen who was managing the Bounty Hotel in Kuta at the time of the attacks, sheltered survivors in the immediate aftermath of the blasts. He was singled out for praise with the award of the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) on 13 June 2005. [9] [10]
Husband and wife Richard [11] and Gilana Poore, [12] who organised a makeshift triage area in the Bounty Hotel's reception area, were both honoured with an OAM.
James Parkinson, an emergency nurse, worked alongside Doctor Hogg from Wollongong in the Denpasar Sanglah Hospital running the trauma centre for the bombing victims. After disappearing in Africa and Europe for three years, the Governor General 's department finally tracked him down and awarded Parkinson the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2005. [13]
Senior Constable Timothy Britten and Mr Richard Joyes of Western Australia were both awarded the Cross of Valour for their actions during the course of the day. The Cross of Valour is the highest civil honour and is equivalent to the Victoria Cross for Australia which is the highest military honour.
The Mitsubishi L300 van bomb was initially thought to have consisted of C4 , a military grade plastic explosive which is difficult to obtain. However, investigators discovered the bomb was made from potassium chlorate , aluminum powder, and sulfur .[ citation needed ] For the Sari club bomb with the L300 van, the terrorists assembled 12 plastic filing cabinets filled with explosives. The cabinets, each containing a potassium chlorate, aluminum powder, sulfur mixture with a TNT booster, was connected by 150 metres (490 ft) of PETN -filled detonating cord. Ninety-four RDX electric detonators were fitted to the TNT. The total weight of the van bomb was 2,250 pounds (1,020 kg). [14] The large, high-temperature blast damage produced by this mixture was similar to a thermobaric explosive, [15] although the bombers may not have known this. [16]
The organisation suspected of responsibility for the bombing was Jemaah Islamiyah , an Islamist group allegedly led by radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir . [17] [18] A week after the blasts, Arab satellite channel Al-Jazeera put to air an audio-cassette purportedly carrying a recorded voice message from Osama Bin Laden saying that the Bali bombings were in retaliation for support of the United States' war on terror and Australia's role in the liberation of East Timor . [4]
"You will be killed just as you kill, and will be bombed just as you bomb", "Expect more that will further distress you."
The recording did not however claim responsibility for the Bali attack. [4] However, former FBI agent Ali Soufan confirmed that al-Qaeda did in fact finance the attack. [19] In addition, Hambali confessed that al-Qaeda had sent him $US30,000 to fund the bombings of the two nightclubs. [20]
The Indonesian chief of police, General Da'i Bachtiar said that the bombing was the "worst act of terror in Indonesia's history".
Aris Munandar (aka Sheik Aris) is a Jemaah Islamiyah associate linked to Bashir. He is believed to have assisted the Bali bomber Amrozi in acquiring some of the explosives used in the Bali bombings. Philippine intelligence considers Munandar to be associated with Mohammad Abdullah Sughayer, a Saudi national Abu Sayyaf Group in southern Philippines. Munandar is still at large. A report by the United States-Indonesia Society describes the arrest of Amrozi and other suspects. [21]
General Pastika ordered his men to make the arrest early the next morning, November . Amrozi was asleep in the rear of the house. According to Greg Barton's account, Amrozi did not attempt to escape, but laughed instead, later exclaiming, ''Gosh, you guys are very clever, how did you find me?" Amrozi's mobile phone, a particularly important piece of evidence, was seized during his arrest. Bags of chemical ingredients for bombs were found in his workshop and soil samples taken from outside his home showed traces of the primary chemical used in the Sari Club bomb. Police found receipts for the purchase of chemicals used to make the bombs, as well as a list of expenses incurred in making the bombs. Further search of Amrozi's home revealed copies of speeches by Osama bin Laden, and Abu Bakar Bashir, the radical Indonesian Muslim cleric reputed to be the leader of Jemaah Islamiyah. The speeches exhorted listeners to wage jihad. Police also uncovered training manuals on ambush techniques and numerous articles on jihad. Under questioning Amrozi revealed the names of six others involved in the bombing: Ali Imron, Imam Samudra, Dul Matin, Idris, Abdul Ghani and Umar Patek. But Amrozi's mobile phone proved to be the real catch. Indonesian investigators were able to print out a list of calls he had made immediately before, during and after the bombing, as well as the names and telephone numbers in the phone's memory. Pastika kept Amrozi's arrest secret for two days. After it was announced, Polri monitored the sudden flurry of communications among numbers listed in Amrozi's telephone before the calls abruptly ceased. The investigators were able to identify the location of a number of the telephones, leading to a series of arrests.
Indonesian authorities also believe more suspects remain at large. In 2005, Indonesian police arrested 24 additional people suspected of involvement in the Bali attacks and a 2003 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta .
On 12 October 2005, a story in Australian broadcaster SBS 's documentary series Dateline , called "Inside Indonesia's War on Terrorism", argued that the Indonesian military or police may have been involved in executing the attack. [22]
On 13 June 2007, it was reported that Abu Dujana , who might have headed a terrorist cell in Bali, was captured. [23]
Just past midnight on 9 November 2008, the three convicted of carrying out the bombings (Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim, and Ali Ghufron) were executed by a firing squad.
Umar Patek was finally arrested in Abbottabad Pakistan in early 2011. [24] The U.S. government had offered a US$1 million reward for his arrest for Patek who is suspected in other bombings as well as the one in Bali.
Initial charges and trials[ edit ]
In April 2003, Indonesian authorities charged Abu Bakar Bashir (also rendered "Ba'asyir"), the alleged spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, with treason . It was alleged that he tried to overthrow the government and set up an Islamic state. The specific charges against Bashir related to a series of church bombings on Christmas Eve in 2000, and to a plot to bomb United States and other Western interests in Singapore . He was initially not charged over the Bali attack, although he was frequently accused of being the instigator or inspirer of the attack. On 2 September, Bashir was acquitted of treason but convicted of lesser charges and sentenced to a prison term of four years. He said he would appeal. On 15 October 2004, he was arrested by the Indonesian authorities and charged with involvement in another bomb attack, which killed 14 people at the J. W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta on 5 August 2003. Secondary charges in this indictment accused him of involvement in the Bali bombing, the first time he faced charges in relation to this attack. On 3 March 2005, Bashir was found not guilty of the charges surrounding the 2003 bombing, but guilty of conspiracy over the 2002 attacks in Bali. He was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. The Australian, US, and many governments expressed its disappointment that the sentence was too short; in the outcome, Bashir was freed 14 June 2006 having served less than 26 months for his conspiracy, [25] and on 21 December 2006, Bashir's conviction was overturned by Indonesia's Supreme Court.
On 30 April 2003, the first charges related to the Bali bombings were made against Amrozi bin Haji Nurhasyim, known as Amrozi, for allegedly buying the explosives and the van used in the bombings. On 8 August he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Another participant in the bombing, Imam Samudra , was sentenced to death on 10 September. Amrozi's brother, Ali Imron, who had expressed remorse for his part in the bombing, was sentenced to life imprisonment on 18 September. A fourth accused, Ali Ghufron , the brother-in-law of Noordin Mohammed Top was sentenced to death on 1 October.
Ali Ghufron, alias Mukhlas, told police that he was the head of one of Jemaah Islamiyah's four cells and had ordered the Bali bombings. He also confessed that a fellow leader Riduan Isamuddin, known as Hambali, had provided the funds for the attacks. He told police, I do not know for sure the source of the aforementioned money from Hambali; most probably it was from Afghanistan, that is, from Sheikh Usama bin Laden. As far as I know, Hambali did not have a source of funds except from Afghanistan. Another operative, Wan Min bin Wan Mat, revealed to police that he had given Mukhlas money, at Hambali's request and that he understood part of the money had come directly from al-Qaeda.
As noted below, all three were executed on 9 November 2008. The Australian, US, and many other foreign governments expressed satisfaction with the speed and efficiency with which the Indonesian police and courts dealt with the bombing's primary suspects, despite what they characterized as light sentences. All Australian jurisdictions abolished the death penalty more than 30 years ago, but a poll[ citation needed ] showed that 55% of Australians approved of the death sentences in the Bali cases. The Australian government said it would not ask Indonesia to refrain from using the death penalty.
On 15 August, Riduan Isamuddin , generally known as Hambali, described as the operational chief of Jemaah Islamiyah was arrested in Ayutthaya, Thailand, the old capital one hour's drive north of Bangkok . He is in American custody in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and has not been charged in relation to the Bali bombing or any other crime.
On 23 July 2004, one of the convicted bombers, Maskur Abdul Kadir, successfully appealed his conviction. He had been tried under retroactive laws which were introduced after the bombing and which were employed to aid the prosecution of those involved in the attack. These laws were used by the prosecution instead of existing criminal laws as they allowed the death penalty to be imposed and lowered certain evidentiary restrictions.
The highest court in Indonesia, the Constitutional Court, found by a margin of five to four that trying the terrorist suspects under these retroactive laws violated Article 28I(1) of the constitution [2]. The minority judges argued that international human rights documents such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights allowed an exception to not applying retrospective legislation in the prosecution of crimes against humanity. The majority found that this argument was inconsistent with the text of Article 28I(1) which states that the rights listed there "cannot be limited under any circumstances."

Following this decision, charges related to the bombings against Idris, who had confessed to participating in the attacks to the police and court, were dismissed. The legal status of Kadir, Idris and others who might have their convictions quashed following the ruling on the retrospective law is unclear.
The Constitutional Court is a relatively new body, created after the fall of Suharto , and this decision was one of the first to overrule the constitutionality of the government's application of a law.
Execution of perpetrators[ edit ]
On 24 October 2008, Bali officials announced that three men convicted of carrying out the bombings would be executed by firing squad in November 2008. [26] [27] [28] On 25 October 2008, Communications and Information Minister asked the Indonesian media to stop calling the three heroes. [29]
The Denpasar District Court, on 3 November, accepted a reprieve motion to reconsider the death sentences. [30] [31] Fahmi Bachmid, a lawyer for the family of Jafar Sodiq, a brother of Amrozi and Mukhlas, stated: "We lodged the judicial review to Denpasar court to question (previous) decisions." Lawyer Imam Asmara Hadi stated: "We have lodged an appeal because we haven't received a copy of the Supreme Court rejection of our previous appeal."
Indonesia's Supreme Court denied previous petitions for judicial review amid the constitutional court's dismissal of the bombers' appeals. Denpasar court official Nengah Sanjaya said the 3-page appeal would be sent to a Cilacap , central Java court. But the Attorney General's office said on 1 November the execution was "very close." [32] Supreme Court judge Djoko Sarwoko, however, said a "last-minute legal challenge by the relatives of Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim and Ali Ghufron will not change or delay the execution." They were moved to isolation cells, and execution spots were ready on the Nusakambangan island prison where they are being held. Local chief prosecutor Muhammad Yamin said they will be "executed simultaneously" but at different locations. [33] Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim and Ali Ghufron were executed by firing squad after midnight on 9 November 2008 ( West Indonesian time ). [34] In the final moment, there was no remorse or repentance, and they shouted: Allahu Akbar , or "God is great!" [35] For burial, Mukhlas and Amrozi's bodies were flown by helicopter to Tenggulan, Lamongan , East Java , while Imam Samudra's body was flown to Serang , Banten , amid "welcome martyrs" banner displayed at the cemetery. The execution caused high tension and sparked clashes in Tenggulan between hundreds of police and supporters. [36] [37] Indonesian singer and TV presenter Dorce Gamalama attended the funeral of Imam Samudra. After praying with the crowd, she spent half an hour in the house of the executed man and spoke with his mother. On leaving she was quoted as saying "I'm certain he's gone to heaven". [38] Maaruf Amin, deputy chairman of the Indonesian Ulemas Council, the chief body for Islamic clerics in Indonesia said of the men: "They did not die a holy death. That can only be in a war and Indonesia is not at war." [39]
Long Road to Heaven[ edit ]
Peace Park at the former site of the Sari Club
In 2006, Long Road to Heaven , an Indonesian feature film about the bombings was released by Kalyana Shira Films. The film was directed by Enison Sinaro and written by Wong Wai Leng and Andy Logam-Tan. It stars Raelee Hill , Mirrah Foulkes , Alex Komang, Surya Saputra, John O' Hare, Sarah Treleaven, and Joshua Pandelaki.
It tells the story during three different times: the planning a few months before the bombing, its execution in 2002, and the trials in 2003 through the viewpoints of both the victims and the bombers. The story is not chronologically linear, starting with the explosion and then moving from time to time so as all three plots are culminated one after the other. At the beginning of each scene, subtitles tell the date and location of the scene.
List of victims
A permanent memorial was built on the site of the destroyed Paddy's Pub on Legian Street. (A new bar, named "Paddy's: Reloaded", was reopened further along Legian Street). The memorial is made of intricately carved stone, set with a large marble plaque, which bears the names and nationalities of each of those killed. It is flanked by the national flags of the victims. The monument is well-maintained and illuminated at night.
The memorial was dedicated on 12 October 2004, the second anniversary of the attack. The dedication included a Balinese Hindu ceremony and the opportunity for mourners to lay flowers and other offerings. The Australian ambassador and Indonesian officials attended the ceremony.
The Balinese mark their commitment in a nine-day long event. After major cleansing ceremonies, establishing a memorial for the lost lives, and paying respect to those who left loved ones behind, the people of Kuta look forward to restoring Bali's image through an event named "Kuta Karnival — A Celebration of Life". The community event consists of traditional art performances such as Balinese Sunset Dances, sports on the beach as well as in the water for young and old plus rows and rows of culinary displays along the one kilometre of sandy beach.
In line with the return of tourism to Kuta, Kuta Karnival has grown into a tourism promotional event with major coverage from television and newspapers from across the globe. Companies, embassies, Non-Government Organizations, associations and even individuals come forth to get involved in the various events such as a Balinese dance competition presented by a surf-wear company, an environment exhibition presented by an embassy, a fun cycle presented by a group of individuals, a seminar presented by an association and a parade on the streets presented by an NGO. Tourists and locals alike, more than ninety thousand people participates in the numerous events, year after year.
A repeated tragedy in Bali in 2005 did not reduce the Kuta community's determination to carry out this annual event. Kuta Karnival is conducted to commemorate and give respect to the victims of human violence and show the world the true spirit of local community survival despite terrorism attacks.
On 12 October 2010, Australian and Indonesian survivors of the 2002 bombings attended a solemn commemoration service to mark the eighth anniversary of the devastating attacks. [40]
Bali 2002 bombing memorial, Swanston Street, Melbourne
In Lincoln Square (park) on the western side of Swanston Street , Melbourne, Australia , just north of the city blocks, is a memorial representing the 88 Australians who died in the bombings, and notably the 22 from Victoria .
There are 88 jets in the fountain; at night there are lights representing all those who died. The fountain shuts off and becomes a reflecting pool on 12 October each year.
This was one of the very few fountains allowed to operate during the drought in 2007.
Memorial at Kings Park, Perth
A memorial which lists the W.A victims of the bombings was opened on the first anniversary, and is situated on the ridge of Mount Eliza in Kings Park , overlooking the city. The memorial is specifically designed to frame the sun's rays at dawn on 12 October each year and faces in the exact direction of Bali.
An Indonesian-style stone memorial is situated in Allambe Memorial Park at Nerang. A bronze plaque lists the names of the 88 Australians who died in the bombings. An annual twilight service is held at the site of the memorial on each anniversary of the Bali bombings.
On the northern side of Coogee Beach a memorial to the Bali bombing victims comprises three interlocking bronze shapes that have an abstract resemblance to three bowed figures supporting each other. There are also some graffiti memorials in memory of the dead.
The memorial to seven residents of Sutherland Shire who were victims is at Cronulla . Called The Seed, the work is based on the seed and foliage of the Banksia robur , a native plant indigenous to the Shire. This sculpture of pink sandstone is the centrepiece of the memorial. It is set in a black granite pond located in 'Peryman Place' not far from North Cronulla Beach , frequented by many of the seven victims and their families.
Two plaques are set into the granite surrounding the pond. The plaques carry the victims' photos, names, and ages; and also details of the event, the design's symbolism, its dedication, and a poem written by the families of the victims. The work is by sculptor Chris Bennetts and Ishi Buki Sandstone Sculpture. [41]
South of Sydney, in the town of Ulladulla , a large memorial youth centre is being built as a practical and living memorial of Craig Dunn and Danny Lewis, two local (Ulladulla) victims of the bombings. Money is being raised through the Dunn & Lewis Youth Development Foundation. The first stage of the centre is now completed, which includes a 12 lane bowling alley, air conditioned lounge area, food kiosk, and conference room. [42] As soon as financially possible, the second stage will commence, building an auditorium, gymnasium and commence a wide variety of sports and health programs. We aim to complete the commercial kitchen and function rooms to establish additional income streams in this stage. Completion is anticipated by the end of 2012. [43] [44]
A granite cube serves as a memorial in the Eastern Formal Gardens of Parliament House.
List of victims
Prince Charles opened a memorial at the rear of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office headquarters opposite Saint James Park. The memorial consists of a 1.5 metre marble globe, to represent that people from 21 countries were killed, and has 202 doves carved into it. The names of all 202 victims are on a curved stone wall behind the globe. It is the work of artist Garry Breeze and sculptor Martin Cook.
In 2005, two marble wall placards were unveiled at Hong Kong Football Club in memory of the members of the club who were killed in the bombings.
A 130-page comic book about the first Bali Bombing has been launched to promote peace and discourage radicalism and terrorism in Indonesia. The book, titled Ketika Nurani Bicara (When Conscience Speaks), tells about the bombing from the perspective of three people: a volunteer who helped evacuate a bombing victim who lost her husband in the blast; the victim who struggled to raise her children without her husband; and a terrorist who regrets his involvement in the bombing.

The carnage at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.
The bombing yesterday at the Marriott hotel in Pakistan's capital of Islamabad is shaping up to be one of the country's most deadly attacks. The complex attack is the latest in a series of al Qaeda attacks that have occurred in the Middle East and South Asia over the last five years.
More than 70 people have been reported killed and 257 have been reported wounded so far in what the Pakistani press has dubbed " Pakistan's 9/11 ." The death toll is expected to rise as more people are believed to have been trapped in the hotel. Dozens of Westerners have been wounded in the attack, and there are unconfirmed reports one or more Westerners have been killed.
The massive blast left a crater 25 foot deep by 20 feet wide. The blast detonated a natural gas line in the hotel, which then set several floors of the hotel ablaze. Several floors of the hotel are still on fire. The hotel is essentially destroyed, there are fears the structure will collapse due to fire and blast damage. Buildings blocks away were heavily damaged.

The attack was well planned and executed. The strike occurred in a so-called secure zone in Islamabad. Two vehicles were involved in the attack, according to Geo TV . A small vehicle breached the outer security barrier. A large dump truck packed with more than one ton of explosives then moved through the breach and detonated at the front of the hotel.
The Taliban may have been gunning for a high-value target. It was believed President Asif Ali Zardari would be visiting the hotel, but he was reportedly nearby when the blast occurred. Reports indicate teams from the US Central Intelligence Agency as well as US Marines were in the hotel at the time of the attack. Western diplomats, tourists, and businessmen favor the five-star hotel. The attack began in the evening after Muslims broke fast for Ramadan, ensuring the restaurants were filled.
The Marriott attack is one of the largest suicide strikes inside Pakistan over the past year, and the second large-scale bombing in over a month. More than 70 Pakistanis were killed and more than 100 were wounded after two suicide bombers detonated their vests nearly simultaneously outside the gates of the Wah military installation on Aug. 21. The Wah facility hosts elements of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program.
The largest attack in Pakistani history occurred in Karachi on Oct. 18, 2007. Suicide bombers killed more than 130 Pakistanis and wounded more than 500 at a rally held to celebrate the return of Benazir Bhutto, the leader of the Pakistani People's Party. A gunman and suicide bomber killed Benazir Bhutto as she campaigned in the military garrison city of Rawalpindi just two months later.
A potent enemy
The attack on the Islamabad Marriott is the latest in series of complex strikes against hardened locations or military formations in the Middle East and South Asia over the last five years by al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their allies. These attacks require logistical and financial support, training, coordination, intelligence gathering, and access to weapons and explosives.
Al Qaeda and allied movements have conducted multiple complex attacks in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The first strike occurred in Saudi Arabia, before al Qaeda in Iraq even began its insurgency and terror campaign.
Al Qaeda has reformed Brigade 055, the infamous military arm of the terror group made up of Arab recruits, US military and intelligence sources told The Long War Journal in July . The unit is thought to be commanded by Shaikh Khalid Habib al Shami.
Brigade 055 fought alongside the Taliban against the Northern Alliance and was decimated during the US invasion of Afghanistan. Several other Arab brigades have been formed, some consisting of former members of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guards, an intelligence official told The Long War Journal. These units have helped to increase the Taliban's sophistication in military operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
A look at some of the more high-profile complex attacks throughout the Middle East and South Asia over the past five years:
Four vehicles, three carrying explosives and two carrying the assault teams breached the gates of three compounds housing Westerners in the capital city. The assault teams breached the gates and the car bombs were driven into the compounds. Thirty-four people, including eight Americans, were killed and more than 160 were wounded.
Dec. 6, 2004
Al Qaeda hits the front gate of the US Consulate in Jeddah. The gate is breached and an assault force stormed the compound. The terrorist took hostages. Six local staff members, a security guard, and three Saudi soldiers were killed .
April 2, 2005
Al Qaeda in Iraq used car bombs in an attempt to breach the wall of a military prison in Abu Ghraib just west of Baghdad. The bombers were followed up by an infantry assault. US Marines repelled the assault, inflicting heavy casualties on the attackers.
April 13, 2005
Al Qaeda in Iraq attempted to breach the walls of a US military outpost on the Syrian border. Three trucks packed with explosives attempted to punch a hole in the outer wall. Al Qaeda then launched an infantry assault. US Marines repelled the attack, inflicting heavy casualties on al Qaeda forces.
June 24, 2005
More than 100 al Qaeda fighters launched an attack on an Iraqi police station in Baghdad. Like the attacks in Abu Ghraib and Husaybah, the attackers used suicide car and truck bombs and followed up with an infantry assault. The Iraqi Police held their ground and defeated the attack.
Oct. 25, 2005
Al Qaeda launched several car and truck bombs in an attempt to breach the wall of the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad. One truck penetrated the perimeter but the driver detonated after it stalled on the road.
Nov. 10, 2005
Three suicide bombing teams penetrated security and struck nearly simultaneously at the Grand Hyatt, the Radisson SAS and the Days Inn in Amman. The attacks occurred during weddings and other events. Fifty-six civilians were killed and 97 were wounded.
Feb. 25, 2006
Al Qaeda operatives in two cars made to look like ARAMCO vehicles got past the first ring of security but were destroyed after being detected and attacked by facility security guards.
Sept. 15, 2006
Two teams of car bombers dressed in military-styled uniforms attempted to destroy two oil installations at the Masila oil field. Security guards repelled the attacks; one came close to destroying a natural gas line and control room.
Feb. 20, 2007
Three al Qaeda suicide car and truck bombs attempt to breach the perimeter of a combat outpost in Tarmiyah. The bombs were followed up by a conventional assault on the compound. The ground assault was repelled but one of the car bombs exploded near the inner wall. This caused a fuel explosion and the collapse of a tower, killing two US soldiers.
Taliban fighters under the command of Baitullah Mehsud captured a Pakistani regular Army company without firing a shot. The Taliban fighters surrounded the convoy as it moved through the tribal agency, and the Army commander surrendered. The soldiers were exchanged for Taliban prisoners.
South Waziristan, Pakistan
January 2008
A large Taliban force estimated at 400 fighters overran a fort manned by the Frontier Corps in the town of Sararogha . The fort was taken after the Taliban breached an outer wall with a truck bomb. Sixteen Frontier Corps paramilitaries were killed and 24 were captured. A large force of Taliban fighters took control of the Saklatoi Fort the next day without firing a shot and conducted several complex attacks on the Lahda Fort but failed to take it.
July 1, 2008
A large Taliban, al Qaeda, and Haqqani Network force launched a complex military attack against a combat outpost in eastern Afghanistan. The Taliban coordinated indirect fire to maneuver its infantry. US and Afghan forces defeated the attack, killing 33 Taliban fighters.
A joint Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and al Qaeda force launched a complex military attack against a newly built combat outpost in eastern Afghanistan. The enemy force came close to overrunning the outpost. Nine US soldiers were killed in the assault.
Sept. 17, 2008
The Yemeni Islamic Brigades, an al Qaeda affiliate, launched a complex attack against the US Embassy in Sana'a. A car bomb detonated outside the main gate, and then assault teams opened fire on the Yemeni security forces outside the gates. Six terrorists, six Yemeni security guards, and four civilians were killed in the fighting.

i wonder how the pakistani people gonna respond to this
Posted by Raj Kumar at September 21, 2008 6:57 AM ET:
The Pakistani People through their government will respond exactly like they have responded to every other attack by the Paki Taliban and that is too sign more peace deals with the Pakistani Taliban.
I personally think that this was a warning to the President & Prime Minister of Pakistan to lay off the Taliban. Some accounts seem to indicate that the primary target was the PM secretariat and that the hotel was the secondary target when they couldn't get to the Primary.
Pakistan is not Iraq, their will be no uprising here. The Iraqi's for most part are foremost xenophobhic and nationalist first and islamic second. After all they were ruled by what passes for a 'secular' government in their part of the world for most of their histroy.
Pakistan is entirely different story, Pakisatni's have spent the past 60 years chasing after Islam and are now paying the price for it.

They will most likely blame it on thier gov's ties to the US. This is a no-win situation for the US. Do nothing, and the attacks in A-stan increase, possibly a strike against the West hatched in thier P-stani "safe havens". Now, if the US acts unilaterally, and uses its airpower to destroy the camps, compounds, madrosses, and use Spec. Ops to raid inside the tribal areas, we will STILL catch hell. I would rather be pro-active than sit and let these places operate with impunity. P-stan does not even govern these areas, the T-BAN/AQ do. If it were a court room, the P-stani's case would be weak...if not laughable. How much territory did they cede to these cretins? So, to me, I see it as a free fire zone. Knocking those camps off would probably bring a measure of stability to A-stan. We would be hitting them where they live, and ya can't be in 2 places at one time.

great compilation Bill, I'll bookmark this one.
Posted by Caleb at September 21, 2008 1:22 PM ET:
Look, here's the deal. I am the fartherest thing from an expert in military strategy, or diplomatic strategy either, but enough is enough. It is time for the American military to administer a truly serious strike, or series of strikes on AlQ and the Taliban inside Pakistan. It is time for the American government to show the Pakistani government that we will not tolerate this kind of terrorism against us and our interests, no matter on whose territory it occurs. It is time for the Pakistani government to wake up from their appeasement strategy with the terrorists. It is time for the American government to demonstrate that even during an election campaign we can, and will, take the steps necessary to protect our national interests. It is time that a whole series of co-ordinated strikes on the terrorist bases and safe houses to occur. If that occurs solely with air strikes, or with Spec. Ops. actions mixed in, is not important to me, only that it is time to make it happen. But at my age, there is no chance that I will have to be in harms way either, so I hesitate to opine on this subject. I just think that the Islamic Jihad against America and Israel will continue to escalate until we make them pay a price that is truly significant, and that means that we will see more of our citizens killed and maimed then if we bite the bullet and do what we must do now, and may God bless whatever actions we take and the warriors involved therein.

Just watching the Pakistan government in action under normal conditions is example of confusion. A decapitation strike may shatter the chain of control on nuclear weapons. In confusion there is opportunity. Are the bad guys setting the conditions to acquire a Pak nuclear device? Why try to build one when the parts are in your neighborhood.

The Marriott Hotel chain needs to move the hotel to a more appropriate site with sufficient "set back" and/or distance from the street. Trucks should be banned from the site.
Posted by Private Finch at September 22, 2008 8:59 AM ET:
Pakistan has allowed the border to be turned into a 'free fire zone' and now they are paying the price for foolish apeasement with the T-ban. Now the T-ban have moved into this zone P-stan have given them. Pakistan in now having the worst of both worlds - an out of control T-ban infested border and the US going after combatants given sanctuary in P-stan. Pakistan has spent too much time being focused on India and forgotten the growing Islamic problem.
Posted by Neo at September 22, 2008 9:26 AM ET:
We'll have to see if this bombing has any effect on the Pakistani governments offensive in Bajaur. This hits very close to home. One might expect it both stiffens the resolve and underlines the seriousness of the situation for Pakistan's leadership.
Posted by captainjohann at September 22, 2008 11:20 AM ET:
Hi Bill,
I am little dissappointed with this report. Only a day before as per MNA of PPP who was having dinner inside the hotel, a white van brought some marines who carried some heavy steel boxes to 4th and 5ht floor of the hotel.The marines carried the boxes themselves and didnot allow the Xray scanners to scan them.The MNA informed the hotel security who have already blocked the entrance for this ooperation.Now the brother of this MNA who is a journalist checked in to find out more.
1.Now the dumper truck was not allowed to enter the hotel and the crater was formed outside.
2.But fire catches ONLY on 4th and 5th floor only due to gas leak as per report.This is very suspicious.
3,.From the pictures i find that the hotel was burning from 4th floor up.
to me it looks like an insider operation by some high profile operative who wanted to get hold of those steel boxes.
One CIA and Danish intelligence operative are still missing and their bodies are not found.To me it looks like some body kidnapped these guys and took away the boxes if they are of high value.
suddenly there were blogs blaming Indian RAW for the operation
A very mysterious operation by whoever done it.

The Pakistani landscape has changed. One Pak leader said "this is Pakistan's 9/11." Thus, the political door is open and the time to strike is now.

"The massive blast left a crater 25 foot deep by 20 feet wide"
I am not an expert, but this does not sound right. Shouldn't the crater be several times wider than it's depth?
Posted by My2cents at September 22, 2008 8:18 PM ET:
The article linked on the sidebar gave the correct dimensions of the crater "24 feet deep and 59x63 feet in diameter". That makes sense.

It don't know which pictures you're looking at, but the pictures in the article show flames coming out the windows on the 2nd floor.
The flames DO reach the 5th floor but, given that flames travel up rather than down, it is more likely the fire started near the ground and moved up.

The United States presidential election of 2008 was the 56th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday, November 4, 2008. Democratic Party nominee Senator Barack Obama and running mate Senator Joe Biden defeated Republican Party nominee Senator John McCain and running mate Governor Sarah Palin .
McCain secured the Republican nomination by March 2008, but the Democratic nomination was marked by a sharp contest between Obama and initial frontrunner Senator Hillary Clinton , with Obama not securing the nomination until early June. Early campaigning had focused heavily on the Iraq War and the unpopularity of outgoing Republican President George W. Bush , but all candidates focused on domestic concerns as well, which grew more prominent as the economy experienced the onset of the Great Recession and a major financial crisis that peaked in September 2008 .
Obama would go on to win a decisive victory over McCain, winning both the popular vote and the electoral college , with 365 electoral votes to McCain's 173; he received the largest percentage of the popular vote for a Democrat in nearly a half-century . Obama's successes in obtaining a major party's nomination and winning the general election were both firsts for an African American . Although Hillary Clinton did not win the Democratic nomination, she was the first woman to win a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection when she won the primary in New Hampshire on January 8. [2] [3] [nb 1] She also was the first woman to be an American presidential candidate in every primary and caucus in every state. [6] Similarly, Sarah Palin became the first woman to appear on a Republican presidential ticket, and the second woman overall to appear on a major party's presidential ticket (after Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 ).
This was notable as the first election since 1952 where neither of the two major candidates were either the incumbent president or vice president. Obama's total vote amount of 69.5 million votes is the highest amount ever won by a presidential candidate. The total of 131 million votes cast in the election represents over 43% of the total U.S. population, the highest share of any presidential election in U.S. history. [7] [8]

In 2004 , President George W. Bush won reelection , defeating the Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry . After Republican pickups in the House and Senate in the 2004 elections, Republicans maintained control of the executive and legislative branches of the federal government.
Bush's approval ratings had been slowly declining from their high point of almost 90% after 9/11 , [9] and they were barely 50% by his reelection. Although Bush was reelected with a larger Electoral College margin than in 2000 , during his second term, Bush's approval rating dropped more quickly, with the Iraq War and the federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 being most detrimental to the public's perception of his job performance. [10] [11]
By September 2006, Bush's approval rating was below 40%, [12] and in the November United States Congressional elections 2006 , Democrats gained the majority in both houses. Bush's approval ratings dropped for the last two years in office to the 25–37% range. [13] [14] [15]
In the United States, there are two major political parties , the Democratic Party and the Republican Party . There are also several minor parties, usually called third parties, though most media and public focus is on the two major parties.
Each major party hosts candidates who go through a nomination process to determine the presidential nominee for that party. The nomination process consists of primaries and caucuses, held by the 50 states, as well as Guam , Puerto Rico , Washington, D.C. , U.S. Virgin Islands , American Samoa , and the Northern Mariana Islands . The winner of each of these primary elections usually receives delegates proportional to the percentage of the popular vote that candidate received in each states. In many Republican primaries, all the state's delegates are awarded to the winning candidate. In the Democratic Party, high-ranking party members known as superdelegates each receive one vote in the convention. Whichever candidate has the majority of the delegates at the end of the primary elections is designated the presumptive nominee until he or she is formally nominated and endorsed for the presidency by his or her political party. This is done by the aforementioned delegates for each party.

Before the primaries[ edit ]
Media speculation had begun almost immediately after the results of the 2004 presidential elections became known. In the 2006 midterm elections , the Democrats regained majorities in both houses of Congress . [16] Early polls taken before anyone had announced a candidacy had shown Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as the most popular potential Democratic candidates. [17] Nevertheless, the media speculated on several other candidates, including Al Gore , the runner-up in the 2000 election ; John Kerry , the runner-up in the 2004 election ; John Edwards , his running mate ; Delaware Senator Joseph Biden; New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson; Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack; and Indiana Senator Evan Bayh. [18]
Edwards was one of the first to formally announce his candidacy for the presidency, on December 28, 2006. This run would be his second attempt at the presidency. [19] Clinton announced intentions to run in the Democratic primaries on January 20, 2007. [20] Obama announced his candidacy on February 10 in his home state of Illinois. [20] None of the candidates received a significant bounce in their poll numbers after their official announcements. [21] Through most of 2007, even after it was evident Al Gore would not run, John Edwards and Al Gore each hovered between the third and fourth place spots in the polls behind Clinton and Obama. [22]
"Front-runner" status is dependent on the news agency reporting, and by October 2007, the consensus listed the three aforementioned candidates as leading the pack after several debate performances. The Washington Post listed Clinton, Edwards and Obama as the front runners, "leading in polls and fundraising and well ahead of the other major candidates". [23] Clinton led in nearly all nationwide opinion polling until January 2008. [22]
Comedian Stephen Colbert mounted his own campaign for the nomination in his home state of South Carolina , announcing it in October 2007. [24] Public Opinion Strategies conducted a poll and found Colbert nationally in fifth place at 2.3% behind Joe Biden's 2.7%. [25]
The early primaries and caucuses are considered the most critical of nomination process. Most candidates lacking support drop out after doing poorly in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary , and these states' results often shift national preferences, according to historical polling data. [26] The states that hold early primaries and caucuses are, chronologically, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. In 2008, Florida and Michigan moved their primaries into January against the Democratic Party's rules, and the results of these primaries were discounted and disputed until after the rest of the contests occurred. [27]
At the start of the year, support for Barack Obama began rising in the polls, passing Clinton for first place in Iowa; Obama ended up winning the Iowa caucus, with John Edwards coming in second and Clinton in third. [28] Obama's win was fueled mostly by first time caucus-goers and Independents and showed voters viewed him as the candidate of change. [28] Iowa is viewed as the state that jump-started Obama's campaign and set him on track to win the nomination and the presidency. [29] After the Iowa caucus, Joe Biden and Christopher Dodd withdrew from the nomination contest. [28]
Obama became the new front runner in New Hampshire when his poll numbers skyrocketed after his victory in Iowa. [30] The Clinton campaign was struggling after a bad loss in Iowa and no strategy beyond the early primaries and caucuses. According to The Vancouver Sun , "Campaign strategists had mapped a victory scenario that envisioned the former first lady wrapping up the Democratic presidential nomination by Super Tuesday on Feb. 5." [31] In what is considered a turning point for her campaign, Clinton had a strong performance at the Saint Anselm College , ABC and Facebook debates several days before the New Hampshire primary as well as an emotional interview in a public broadcast live on TV. [32] Clinton won that primary by 2% of the vote, contrary to the predictions of pollsters who consistently had her trailing Obama for a few days up to the primary date. [30] Clinton's win was the first time a woman had ever won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. [33] (Shirley Chisholm's prior "win" in New Jersey in 1972 was in a no-delegate-awarding, presidential preference ballot that the major candidates were not listed in and that the only other candidate who was listed had already withdrawn from; the actual delegate selection vote went to George McGovern . [34] [35] )
On January 30, 2008, after placing in third in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, Edwards announced that he was suspending his campaign for the presidency, but he did not initially endorse any remaining candidate. [36] [37]
Super Tuesday occurred on February 5, 2008, during which the largest-ever number of simultaneous state primary elections was held. [38] Super Tuesday ended up leaving the Democrats in a virtual tie, with Obama amassing 847 delegates to Clinton's 834 from the 23 states that held Democratic primaries. [39]
Earlier, on February 3 on the UCLA campus, celebrities Oprah Winfrey , Caroline Kennedy and Stevie Wonder , among others, made appearances to show support for Barack Obama in a rally led by Michelle Obama . [40] In addition, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger 's wife at the time, Maria Shriver , endorsed Obama. [41] California was one of the Super Tuesday states that were rich in delegates. Obama trailed in the California polling by an average of 6.0% before the primary; he ended up losing the state by 8.3%. [42] Some analysts cited a large Latino turnout that voted for Clinton as the deciding factor. [43]
Louisiana , Nebraska , Hawaii , Wisconsin , U.S. Virgin Islands , the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia primaries and the Washington and Maine caucuses all took place after Super Tuesday in February. Obama won all of them, giving him ten consecutive victories after Super Tuesday. [44] [45]
Ohio, Texas, and Pennsylvania[ edit ]
On March 4, Hillary Clinton carried Ohio and Rhode Island in the Democratic primaries; some considered these wins, especially Ohio, a surprise upset, [46] although she led in the polling averages in both states. [42] [47] She also carried the primary in Texas , but Obama won the Texas caucuses held the same day and netted more delegates from the state than Clinton. [48]
Only one state held a primary in April. This was Pennsylvania , on April 22. Although Obama made a strong effort to win Pennsylvania, Hillary Clinton won the primary by nearly 10%, with approximately 55% of the vote. [49] Obama had outspent Clinton three to one in Pennsylvania, but his comment at a San Francisco fundraiser that small-town Americans "cling" to guns and religion drew sharp criticism from the Clinton campaign and may have hurt his chances in the Keystone State. [50] In addition, Clinton had several advantages in Pennsylvania. Throughout the primary process, she relied on the support of older, white, working class voters. Pennsylvania held a closed primary, which means that only registered Democrats could vote, and, according to Ron Elving of NPR , "The established Democratic electorate was older, whiter, more Catholic and more working-class than in most of the primaries to date." [51] After Pennsylvania, Obama had a higher number of delegates and popular votes than Clinton did and was still in a stronger position to win the nomination. Clinton, however, had received the endorsement of more superdelegates than Obama. [49]
Indiana and North Carolina[ edit ]
On May 6, North Carolina and Indiana held their Democratic presidential primaries. Clinton and Obama campaigned aggressively there before the voting took place. The candidates acknowledged the importance of these primaries and said they were turning point states that could make or break either of their campaigns. [52] Polling had shown Obama a few points ahead in North Carolina and Clinton similarly leading in Indiana. [53] [54] In the actual results, Obama outperformed the polls by several points in both states, winning by a significant margin in North Carolina [55] and losing by only 1.1% in Indiana (50.56% to 49.44%). [56] After these primaries, most pundits declared that it had become increasingly improbable, if not impossible, for Clinton to win the nomination. [57] The small win in Indiana barely kept her campaign alive for the next month. [58] Although she did manage to win the majority of the remaining primaries and delegates, it was not enough to overcome Obama's substantial delegate lead.
Scandal surrounded the primary in Indiana because a Democratic State Committee member and county chair led a forgery ring to get all of the Democratic candidates on the ballot. [59] This Democratic State Committee member, Owen "Butch" Morgan was convicted of felonies regarding the forgeries and sentenced to a year in prison, community corrections, and probation. [60]
All Democratic presidential candidates needed, under Indiana law, 500 signatures per congressional district. Owen "Butch" Morgan, Democrat county chair, congressional district chair, and State Committee member, was convicted as the leader. Congressional candidate Andrew Straw [61] called on Morgan to resign in May 2011 over inaccessibility of the Democratic headquarters in South Bend, but he resigned instead over the petition forgery indictment. [62] [63] Straw is now the state chair of the Disability Party in Indiana. [64]
Florida and Michigan[ edit ]
During late 2007, the two parties adopted rules against states' moving their primaries to an earlier date in the year. For the Republicans, the penalty for this violation was supposed to be the loss of half the state party's delegates to the convention. The Democratic penalty was the complete exclusion from the national convention of delegates from states that broke these rules. The Democratic Party allowed only four states to hold elections before February 5, 2008. Initially, the Democratic leadership said it would strip all delegates from Florida and Michigan , which had moved their primaries into January. In addition, all major Democratic candidates agreed officially not to campaign in Florida or Michigan, and Edwards and Obama removed their names from the Michigan ballot. Clinton won a majority of delegates and popular votes from both states (though 40% voted uncommitted in Michigan) and subsequently led a fight to seat all the Florida and Michigan delegates. [65]
Political columnist Christopher Weber noted that while her action was self-serving, it was also pragmatic to forestall Florida or Michigan voters becoming so disaffected they did not vote for Democrats in the general election. [66] There was some speculation that the fight over the delegates could last until the convention in August. On May 31, 2008, the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic Party reached a compromise on the Florida and Michigan delegate situation. The committee decided to seat delegates from Michigan and Florida at the convention in August, but to only award each a half-vote. [67]
Clinching the nomination[ edit ]
Technically the nomination process for major political parties continues through June of election year. In previous cycles the candidates were effectively chosen by the end of the March primaries. In this cycle, Barack Obama did not win enough delegates to secure the nomination until June 3, after a 17-month-long campaign against Hillary Clinton. Obama had a wide lead in states won, while Clinton had won majorities in several of the larger states. Because a form of proportional representation and popular vote decided Democratic state delegate contests, numbers were close between Clinton and Obama. [68] By May, Clinton claimed to hold a lead in the popular vote, but the Associated Press found her numbers accurate only in one close scenario. [69]
In June, after the last of the primaries had taken place, Obama secured the Democratic nomination for President, with the help of multiple super delegate endorsements (most of the super delegates had refused to declare their support for either candidate until the primaries were completed). [70] He was the first African American to win the nomination of a major political party in the United States. [71] For several days, Clinton refused to concede the race, although she signaled her presidential campaign was ending in a post-primary speech on June 3 in her home state of New York. [72] She finally conceded the nomination to Obama on June 7. She pledged her full support to the presumptive nominee and vowed to do everything she could to help him get elected. [73]

Before the primaries[ edit ]
Immediately after the 2006 midterm elections, media pundits began speculating, as they did about the Democrats, about potential Republican candidates for President in 2008. [17] In November 2006, Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led in the polls, followed closely by Arizona Senator John McCain . [76] The media speculated that Giuliani's pro-choice stance on abortion and McCain's age and support of the unpopular Iraq War would be detriments to their candidacies. [17] Giuliani remained the frontrunner in the polls throughout most of 2007, with McCain and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson fighting for second place. [77] Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee , Giuliani, Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney , and Texas Congressman Ron Paul announced their candidacies on January 28, February 5, February 13, and March 12, respectively. [78] [79] [80] [81] McCain officially announced his candidacy on March 1, 2007, after several informal announcements. [82] In the third quarter of 2007, the top four GOP (Republican) fundraisers were Romney, Giuliani, Thompson, and Ron Paul . [83] MSNBC's Chuck Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the front runners after the second Republican presidential debate in early 2007. [84]
Huckabee, after winning in Iowa, had little money and hoped for a third-place finish in New Hampshire. McCain eventually displaced Rudy Giuliani and Romney as the front runner in New Hampshire . McCain staged a turnaround victory, [85] having been written off by the pundits and polling in single digits less than a month before the race. [86]
With the Republicans stripping Michigan and Florida of half their delegates for moving their primaries into January 2008 against party rules, the race for the nomination was based there. McCain meanwhile managed a small victory over Huckabee in South Carolina , [87] setting him up for a larger and more important victory over Romney in Florida , which held a closed primary on January 29. [88] By this time, after several scandals, no success in the early primaries, and a third-place finish in Florida, Giuliani conceded from the nomination race and endorsed John McCain the next day. [89]
McCain was also endorsed in February by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger before the California primary took place on Super Tuesday. This gave him a significant boost in the polls for the state's primary, [90] which awarded the greatest number of delegates of all the states. On Super Tuesday, McCain won his home state of Arizona, taking all 53 delegates. He also won nearly all of California's 173 delegates, the largest of the Super Tuesday prizes. McCain also scored wins in seven other states, picking up 574 delegates. [91] Huckabee was the "surprise performer", winning 5 states and 218 delegates. [91] Romney won 7 states and 231 delegates. [91] Two days later, Romney suspended his presidential campaign, saying that if he stayed in the race, he would "forestall the launch of a national campaign and be making it easier for Senator Clinton or Obama to win". [92] His departure left Huckabee and Paul as McCain's only major challengers in the remaining primaries and caucuses. Romney endorsed McCain on February 14. [93]
Louisiana, Washington, Kansas , Wisconsin , and Washington held primaries in February after Super Tuesday. Despite McCain picking up big victories, Huckabee won Louisiana and Kansas. McCain narrowly carried the Washington caucuses over Huckabee and Paul, who amassed a large showing. [45] The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico closed February for the Republicans. After Super Tuesday, John McCain had become the clear front runner, but by the end of February, he still had not acquired enough delegates to secure the nomination. In March, John McCain clinched the Republican nomination after sweeping all four primaries, Texas , Ohio , Vermont , and Rhode Island , putting him over the top of the 1,191 delegates required to win the GOP nomination. [47] Mike Huckabee then conceded the race to McCain, leaving Ron Paul, who had just 16 delegates, as his only remaining opponent. [94]
Along with the Democratic and Republican parties, three other parties nominated candidates with ballot access in enough states to win the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. These were the Constitution Party , the Green Party , and the Libertarian Party . In addition, independent candidate Ralph Nader ran his own campaign.
The Green Party nominated former Democratic Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney of Georgia for President, and political activist Rosa Clemente from New York for Vice President. McKinney campaigned on a platform that supported single-payer universal health care , the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, reparations for African Americans, and the creation of a Department of Peace. [98]
The Libertarian Party nominated former Republican Congressman Bob Barr of Georgia for President, and his former rival for the Libertarian nomination Wayne Allyn Root of Nevada, for Vice President. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Barr advocated a reworking or abolishment of the income tax [99] and opposed the war in Iraq [100] and the Patriot Act . [101]

General election campaign[ edit ]
An issue in the election was Obama's possible, [102] [103] [104] and then actual, [105] [106] nomination by the Democratic Party. On August 28, 2008, when Obama formally accepted the Democratic nomination for President, he became the first African American to be nominated for President by a major political party. [105] The television audiences for both McCain's and Obama's acceptance speeches broke records, according to Nielsen ratings . [107]
The unpopular war in Iraq was a key issue during the campaign before the economic crisis . John McCain supported the war while Barack Obama opposed it. (Obama's early and strong opposition to the war helped him stand out against the other Democratic candidates during the primaries, as well as stand out to a war-weary electorate during the general campaign). Though McCain meant it as a peacetime presence like the United States maintained in Germany and Japan after World War II , [108] his statement that the United States could be in Iraq for as much as the next 50 to 100 years would prove costly. Obama used it against him as part of his strategy to tie him to the unpopular President Bush.
John McCain's support for the troop 'surge' employed by General David Petraeus , which was one of several factors credited with improving the security situation in Iraq, may have boosted McCain's stance on the issue in voters' minds. McCain (who supported the invasion) argued that his support for the successful surge showed his superior judgment. However, Obama was quick to remind voters that there would have been no need for a "surge" had there been no war at all, thus questioning McCain's judgment.
George W. Bush had become increasingly unpopular by 2006. Polls consistently showed that about 30 percent of the American public approved of his job performance. [13] [109] [110] In March 2008, Bush endorsed McCain at the White House, [111] but Bush did not make a single appearance for McCain during the campaign. Bush appeared at the 2008 GOP convention only through a live video broadcast. He chose not to appear in person due to disaster events in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav . Although he supported the war in Iraq, McCain made an effort to show that he had disagreed with Bush on many other key issues such as climate change. During the entire general election campaign, Obama countered by pointing out in ads and at numerous campaign rallies that McCain had claimed in an interview that he voted with Bush 90% of the time, and congressional voting records supported this for the years Bush was in office. [112]
Change vs. experience[ edit ]
Before the Democratic primaries began, the dichotomy of change versus experience had already become a common theme in the presidential campaign, with Senator Hillary Clinton positioning herself as the candidate with experience and Obama embracing the characterization as the candidate most able to bring change to Washington. Before the official launch of her campaign , aides for Clinton were already planning to position her as the 'change' candidate, as strategist Mark Penn made clear in an October 2006 memo titled "The Plan." [113] In his presidential run announcement, Obama framed his candidacy by emphasizing that "Washington must change." [114] In response to this, Clinton adopted her experience as a major campaign theme. [115] By early and mid-2007, polls regularly found voters identifying Clinton as the more experienced candidate and Obama as the "fresh" or "new" candidate. [116] [117] Exit polls on Super Tuesday found that Obama won voters who thought that the ability to bring change was the most important quality in a candidate, who made up a majority of the Democratic electorate. By a margin of about 2-1, Clinton was able to make up for this deficiency by an almost total domination among voters who thought experience was the most important quality. [118] These margins generally remained the same until Obama clinched the Democratic nomination on June 3.
Obama campaigning as a symbol of change in Cleveland , Ohio with a "Change We Need" sign
Obama's promised "universal health care, full employment, a green America, and an America respected instead of feared by its enemies". [119] He used new media to "form a bond with his supporters" which helped him "appeal to the youth audience's need to feel special, in-the-know, empowered and special". This was best displayed in his text message announcement of Joe Biden as the vice-presidential candidate. [120] He has also declared, in his book The Audacity of Hope , that he did not experience a religious upbringing. Rather he developed his faith due to the church's ability to motivate social change. [121] Bowdern wrote, "This is best exemplified in his "50 state strategy", where he campaigned in states that historically would never vote for a Democrat. The 2008 presidential election saw a large youth turn out, up to 51%." [122]
John McCain quickly adopted similar campaign themes against Obama at the start of the general election campaign. Polls regularly found the general electorate as a whole divided more evenly between 'change' and 'experience' as candidate qualities than the Democratic primary electorate, which split in favor of 'change' by a nearly 2-1 margin. [123] Advantages for McCain and Obama on experience and the ability to bring change, respectively, remained steady through the November 4 election. However, final pre-election polling found that voters considered Obama's inexperience less of an impediment than McCain's association with sitting President George W. Bush, [124] an association which was rhetorically framed by the Obama campaign throughout the election season as "more of the same".
McCain appeared to undercut his line of attack by picking first-term Alaska governor Sarah Palin to be his running mate. [125] Palin had been governor only since 2006, and before that had been a council member and mayor of Wasilla . Nonetheless, she excited much of the conservative base of the GOP with her speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention , a group that was initially lukewarm toward McCain's candidacy. [126] However, media interviews suggested that Palin lacked knowledge on certain key issues, and they cast doubt among many voters about her qualifications to be Vice President or President. [127] Because of Palin's conservative views, there was also concern that she would alienate independents and moderates, two groups that pundits observed McCain would need to win the election. [128]
Polls taken in the last few months of the presidential campaign and exit polls conducted on Election Day showed the economy as the top concern for voters. [129] [130] In the fall of 2008, many news sources were reporting that the economy was suffering its most serious downturn since the Great Depression . [131] During this period, John McCain's election prospects fell with several politically costly comments about the economy.
On August 20, John McCain said in an interview with Politico that he was uncertain how many houses he and his wife, Cindy, owned; "I think—I'll have my staff get to you." [132] Both on the stump and in Obama's political ad, "Seven", the gaffe was used to portray McCain as unable to relate to the concerns of ordinary Americans. This out-of-touch image was further cultivated when, on September 15, the day of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy , at a morning rally in Jacksonville, Florida, McCain declared that "the fundamentals of our economy are strong," despite what he described as "tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and Wall Street." [133] With the perception among voters to the contrary, the comment appeared to cost McCain politically.
On September 24, 2008, after the onset of the 2008 financial crisis , McCain announced that he was suspending his campaign to return to Washington to help craft a $700 billion bailout package for the troubled financial industry, and he stated that he would not debate Obama until Congress passed the bailout bill. [134] Despite this decision, McCain was portrayed as not playing a significant role in the negotiations for the first version of the bill, which fell short of passage in the House. He eventually decided to attend the first presidential debate on September 26, despite Congress' lack of immediate action on the bill. His ineffectiveness in the negotiations and his reversal in decision to attend the debates were seized upon to portray McCain as erratic in his response to the economy. Days later, a second version of the original bailout bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with Obama, his vice presidential running mate Joe Biden , and McCain all voting for the measure (Hillary Clinton would as well). [135]
All the aforementioned remarks and campaign issues hurt McCain's standing with voters. All these also occurred after the economic crisis and after McCain's poll numbers had started to fall. Although sound bites of all of these "missteps" were played repeatedly on national television, many pundits and analysts say that the actual financial crisis and economic conditions caused McCain's large drop in support in mid-September and severely damaged his campaign. [136] [137]
John McCain 's proposals focused on open-market competition rather than government funding or control. At the heart of his plan were tax credits – $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families who do not subscribe to or do not have access to health care through their employer. To help people who are denied coverage by insurance companies due to pre-existing conditions, McCain proposed working with states to create what he calls a "Guaranteed Access Plan". [138]
Barack Obama called for universal health care . His health care plan proposed creating a National Health Insurance Exchange that would include both private insurance plans and a Medicare-like government run option. Coverage would be guaranteed regardless of health status, and premiums would not vary based on health status either. It would have required parents to cover their children, but did not require adults to buy insurance.
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the two plans had different philosophical focuses. They described the purpose of the McCain plan as to "make insurance more affordable," while the purpose of the Obama plan was for "more people to have health insurance." [139] The Des Moines Register characterized the plans similarly. [140] The Commonwealth Fund concluded that, compared with McCain's approach, Obama's plan could provide more people with affordable health insurance that covers essential services, achieve greater equity in access to care, realize efficiencies and cost savings in the provision of coverage and delivery of care, and redirect incentives to improve quality. [141]
Critics of McCain's plan argued that it would not significantly reduce the number of uninsured Americans, would increase costs, reduce consumer protections and lead to less generous benefit packages. [142] Critics of Obama's plan argued that it would increase federal regulation of private health insurance without addressing the underlying incentives behind rising health care spending. [143] [144] Mark Pauly suggested that a combination of the two approaches would work better than either one alone. [145]
Various analyses of the two candidates' plans came to widely varying predictions of their costs and effects. A comparison by The Tax Policy Center, a project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute estimated that Obama's proposals could cost $1.6 trillion over 10 years, while the tax-related provisions of McCain's proposals could cost $1.3 trillion over the same period. A comparison by The Lewin Group, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group , published in October 2008, found that the McCain plan would reduce the number of uninsured by 21.1 million and cost $2.05 trillion over 10 years, while the Obama plan would reduce the uninsured by 26.6 million and increase federal spending by $1.17 trillion over the same period. [146] Estimates prepared by HSI Networks found that the McCain plan would reduce the uninsured by 27.5 million at an annual cost of $287 billion, [147] and the Obama plan would reduce the uninsured by 25.5 million at an annual cost of $452 billion. [148]
A poll released in early November 2008, found that voters supporting Obama listed health care as their second priority; voters supporting McCain listed it as fourth, tied with the war in Iraq. Affordability was the primary health care priority among both sets of voters. Obama voters were more likely than McCain voters to believe government can do much about health care costs. [149]
In an October 17–20, 2008, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of registered voters, 2% said race made them more likely to vote for Barack Obama, 4% said it made them less likely to do so, and 2% were not sure. The other 92% of respondents said race was not a major factor in their vote. (margin of error was ±2.9%). [150]
A July 18–21, 2008, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed that 20% of African American registered voters and 8% of white registered voters considered race the single most important factor when voting (margin of error was ±3.1%). This percentage increased in both groups from previous polls. [151]
A June 6–9, 2008, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed that 17% were enthusiastic about Obama being the first African American president, 70% were comfortable or indifferent, and 13% had reservations or were uncomfortable (margin of error was ±3.1%). [152]
Obama generally avoided racial issues in his campaign. He would often place white people behind him when in a hall speaking to a large black group in order to avoid racial imagery. [153] On June 11, 2008, Fox News Channel used the phrase "Outraged liberals: Stop picking on Obama's baby mama " in an on screen graphic in a discussion as to whether U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama 's wife, Michelle , was being unfairly criticized. A senior vice president of programming at Fox said in a statement that a producer "exercised poor judgment" during the segment. [154] There were also attempts to interpret a fist tap as either a racial move, or a "terrorist fist jab". [155]
September 26: The first presidential debate took place at the University of Mississippi . The central issues debated were supposed to be foreign policy and national security. However, due to the economic climate, some questions appeared on this topic. The debate was formatted into nine nine-minute segments, and the moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS , introduced the topics. [157]
October 7: The second presidential debate took place at Belmont University . It was a town meeting format debate moderated by NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw , and addressed issues raised by members of the audience, particularly the economy . [159]
October 15: The third and final presidential debate was hosted at Hofstra University . It focused on domestic and economic policy. Like the first presidential debate, it was formatted into segments, with moderator Bob Schieffer introducing the topics. [159]
Another debate was sponsored by the Columbia University political union and took place there on October 19. All candidates who could theoretically win the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election were invited, and Ralph Nader , Cynthia McKinney , and Chuck Baldwin agreed to attend. Amy Goodman , principal host of Democracy Now! , moderated. It was broadcast on cable by C-SPAN and on the Internet by Break-the-Matrix. [160]
The reported cost of campaigning for president has increased significantly in recent years. One source reported that if the costs for both Democratic and Republican campaigns were added together (for the presidential primary election, general election, and the political conventions), the costs have more than doubled in only eight years ($448.9 million in 1996, $649.5 million in 2000, and $1.01 billion in 2004). [161] In January 2007, Federal Election Commission Chairman Michael E. Toner estimated that the 2008 race would be a $1 billion election, and that to be taken seriously, a candidate would have needed to raise at least $100 million by the end of 2007. [162]
Although he had said he would not be running for president, published reports in 2007 indicated that billionaire and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg had been considering a presidential bid as an independent with up to $1 billion of his own fortune to finance it. [163] Bloomberg ultimately ended this speculation by unequivocally stating that he would not run. [164]
With the increase in money expenditures, many candidates did not use the public financing system funded by the presidential election campaign fund checkoff . John McCain, [165] Tom Tancredo, [166] John Edwards, [167] Chris Dodd, [168] and Joe Biden [169] qualified for and elected to take public funds throughout the primary process. Major Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama chose not to participate in the public financing system. [170]
According to required campaign filings as reported by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), 148 candidates for all parties collectively raised $1,644,712,232 and spent $1,601,104,696 for the primary and general campaigns combined through November 24, 2008. The amounts raised and spent by the major candidates, according to the same source, were as follows:

Notable expressions and phrases[ edit ]
That One : McCain's reference to Obama during the 2nd debate.
Lipstick on a pig : Obama used this phrase to insinuate that any changes that McCain was advocating from the policies of George W. Bush would only be slight modifications of Bush's policies but the underlying policies would be the same, and in Obama's opinion, bad. Some Republicans called it sexism, claiming it was a reference to Sarah Palin, who cracked a joke during the Republican convention that the only difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is lipstick. [172]
Howard Dean collected large contributions through the Internet in his 2004 primary run. In 2008, candidates went even further to reach out to Internet users through their own sites and such sites as YouTube , MySpace , and Facebook . [173] [174]
On December 16, 2007, Ron Paul collected $6 million , more money on a single day through Internet donations than any presidential candidate in US history. [175] [176] [177]
Not only did the Internet allow candidates to raise money, but also it gave them a tool to appeal to newer and younger demographics. Political pundits were now evaluating candidates based on their social media following. Senator Barack Obama's victory is credited to his competitive edge in social media and Internet following. Obama had over 2 million American supporters on Facebook and 100,000 followers on Twitter , while McCain attracted only 600,000 Facebook supporters (likes) and 4,600 followers on Twitter. Obama's YouTube channel held 115,000 subscribers and more than 97 million video views. Obama had maintained a similar advantage over Senator Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Primary. [178]
Obama's edge in social media was crucial to the election outcome. According to a study by the Pew Internet and American Life project, 35 percent of Americans relied on online video for election news. Ten percent of Americans used social networking sites to learn about the election. [179] The 2008 election showed huge increases in Internet use.
Another study done after the election gave a lot of insight on young voters. Thirty-seven percent of Americans ages 18–24 got election news from social networking sites. Almost a quarter of Americans saw something about the election in an online video. [180] YouTube and other online video outlets allowed candidates to advertise in ways like never before.
Social media allowed voters to share their voting experience. On November 5, 2008 at 10:30 p.m., 4.9 million Facebook users had already posted an announcement that they had voted, simply by checking a box on the site. Various websites allowed voters to share concerns over voting malfunctions, ballot shortages and other problems. Social media and the Internet provided a new and interactive voting experience. [181]
Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama created a broad popular movement and a new method of campaigning by courting and mobilizing activists, donations, and voters through the Internet. It was part of a campaign that mobilized grassroots workers in every state. Obama also set fundraising records in more than one month by gaining support from a record-breaking number of individual small donors. [182]
Anonymous and semi-anonymous smear campaigns , traditionally done with fliers and push calling , also spread to the Internet. [183] Organizations specializing in the production and distribution of viral material, such as Brave New Films , emerged; such organizations have been said to be having a growing influence on American politics. [184]
YouTube was considered to be a valuable asset for free advertising. Joe Trippi, the manager of Howard Dean's presidential campaign, claimed that Obama's YouTube campaign material was watched for 14.5 million hours, a viewing that would have cost $47 million for broadcast television. [180] YouTube and other online video outlets allowed candidates to advertise in ways like never before.
The percentage of Americans who regularly rely on the Internet for campaign news almost doubled (13 to 24 percent) from 2004 to 2008, according to a 2008 study from the Pew Research Center. The percentage of Americans who relied on traditional news sources was either stagnant or declining. [185]
A 2011 study by Ad Age magazine shows that 39 percent of voting-age social media users repost and share political messages. The study also recorded 1/3 of Facebook friends opening video or article links. The 2008 election was a catalyst for Internet use in American politics. Jay Samit, a writer at Ad Age magazine, predicted the 2012 election to be "the most participatory election in our nation's history" because of social media. [186]
Some pre-election controversies in the election revolved around challenges to voter registration lists, involving techniques such as caging lists alleged to constitute voter suppression .
Allegations of voter list purges using unlawful criteria caused controversy in at least six swing states : Colorado , Indiana , Ohio , Michigan , Nevada and North Carolina . [187] On October 5, 2008 the Republican Lt. Governor of Montana, John Bohlinger , accused the Montana Republican Party of vote caging to purge 6,000 voters from three counties which trend Democratic. [188] Allegations arose in Michigan that the Republican Party planned to challenge the eligibility of voters based on lists of foreclosed homes. [189] The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama filed a lawsuit challenging this. The House Judiciary Committee wrote to the Department of Justice requesting an investigation. [190]
Virginia election authorities were ordered by a federal judge to preserve late-arriving absentee ballots sent by active-duty military personnel following a suit by the McCain campaign. It alleged that the state sent absentee ballots late to service members. [191] According to federal law, absentee ballots must be mailed to troops in foreign countries at least 45 days before an election. The charge against Virginia was that the ballots were not printed until after the deadline and therefore were mailed late to soldiers abroad. [192]
Guam 's 173,000 residents are U.S. citizens, and must obey U.S. laws passed in Washington, yet they have neither a voting member of Congress, nor votes in the Electoral College. [193] Since 1980, they have held a straw poll for president at the same time as the U.S. national elections. In 2007, Guam's legislature voted to move the straw poll up to September to draw attention to the choices of Guam's population and their continued disfranchisement, [193] but the governor vetoed the bill. [194] Obama won the 2008 Guam straw poll with 20,120 votes to McCain's 11,940. [195]
Libertarian candidate Bob Barr filed a lawsuit in Texas to have Obama and McCain removed from the ballot in that state. [196] His campaign alleged that both the candidates had missed the August 26 deadline to file, and were present on the ballot contrary to Texas election law. Neither candidate at the time of the deadline had been confirmed as the candidate for their respective parties. The Texas Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit without explanation. [197]
In Ohio , identified by both parties as a key state, allegations surfaced from both Republicans and Democrats that individuals from out of state were moving to the state temporarily and attempting to vote despite not meeting the state's requirement of permanent residency for more than 29 days. The Franklin County Board of Elections referred 55 cases of possible voting irregularities to the local prosecutor. [198] Three groups attracted particular notice: 'Vote from Home,' 'Vote Today Ohio,' and 'Drop Everything and Come to Ohio.' Vote from Home attracted the most attention when thirteen of the group's members moved to the same location in eastern Columbus. Members of the group organized by Marc Gustafson, including several Marshall and Rhodes scholars studying at Oxford University , settled with Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien to have their challenged ballots withdrawn. [199] [200] [201] [202] The Obama campaign and others alleged that members of the McCain campaign had also voted without properly establishing residency. [198] Since 1953, only six people in Ohio have gone to prison for illegal voting. [203]
Republicans leveled significant criticism at media outlets' coverage of the presidential election season. An October 22, 2008 Pew Research Center poll estimated 70% of registered voters believed journalists wanted Barack Obama to win the election, as opposed to 9% for John McCain. [204] Another Pew survey, conducted after the election, found that 67% of voters thought that the press fairly covered Obama, versus 30% who viewed the coverage as unfair. Regarding McCain, 53% of voters viewed his press coverage as fair versus 44% who characterized it as unfair. Among affiliated Democrats, 83% believed the press fairly covered Obama; just 22% of Republicans thought the press was fair to McCain. [205]
At the February debate, Tim Russert of NBC News was criticized for what some perceived as disproportionately tough questioning of Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton . [206] Among the questions, Russert had asked Clinton, but not Obama, to provide the name of the new Russian President ( Dmitry Medvedev ). [206] This was later parodied on Saturday Night Live . In October 2007, liberal commentators accused Russert of harassing Clinton over the issue of supporting drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants . [207]
On April 16, ABC News hosted a debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . Moderators Charles Gibson and George Stephanopoulos were criticized by viewers, bloggers and media critics for the poor quality of their questions. [206] [207] Many viewers said they considered some of the questions irrelevant when measured against the importance of the faltering economy or the Iraq war . Included in that category were continued questions about Obama's former pastor, Senator Hillary Clinton's assertion that she had to duck sniper fire in Bosnia more than a decade ago, and Senator Obama's not wearing an American flag pin. [206] The moderators focused on campaign gaffes and some believed they focused too much on Obama. [207] Stephanopoulos defended their performance, saying "Senator Obama was the front-runner" and the questions were "not inappropriate or irrelevant at all." [206] [207]
In an op-ed published on 2008 April 27 in The New York Times , Elizabeth Edwards wrote that the media covered much more of "the rancor of the campaign" and "amount of money spent" than "the candidates' priorities, policies and principles." [208] Author Erica Jong commented that "our press has become a sea of triviality, meanness and irrelevant chatter." [209] A Gallup poll released on May 29, 2008 also estimated that more Americans felt the media was being harder on Hillary Clinton than they were towards Barack Obama. [210]
The Project for Excellence in Journalism and Harvard University's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy conducted a study of 5,374 media narratives and assertions about the presidential candidates from January 1 through March 9, 2008. The study found that Obama received 69% favorable coverage and Clinton received 67%, compared to only 43% favorable media coverage of McCain. [211] Another study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University found the media coverage of Obama to be 72% negative from June 8 to July 21 compared to 57% negative for McCain. [212] An October 29 study found 29% of stories about Obama to be negative, compared to 57% of stories about McCain being negative. [213]

Election Day was on November 4, 2008. The majority of states allowed early voting, with all states allowing some form of absentee voting. [214] Voters cast votes for listed presidential candidates but were actually selecting representatives for their state's Electoral College slate.
A McCain victory quickly became improbable as Obama amassed early wins in his home state of Illinois , the Northeast , and the critical battleground states of Ohio (which no Republican has ever been elected President without winning) and Pennsylvania by 9:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. [215] Obama won the entire Northeast by comfortable margins and the Great Lakes states of Michigan , Wisconsin , and Minnesota by double digits. McCain held on to traditionally Republican states like North Dakota , South Dakota , Nebraska , Kansas , Oklahoma , Montana , Utah , Idaho , Wyoming , and his home state of Arizona . McCain, unlike Bush in 2000 and 2004, failed to win all the southern states: Obama won Florida , North Carolina , and Virginia . Obama also won the hotly contested states of Iowa and New Mexico , which Al Gore had won in 2000 and George W. Bush in 2004. Also, for only the second time since 1940 ( 1964 being the other), Indiana went Democratic, giving Obama all eight Great Lakes states, the first time a presidential candidate had won all of them since Richard Nixon in 1972 .
CNN and Fox News called Virginia for Obama shortly before 11:00 PM, leaving him only 50 electoral votes shy of victory with only six West Coast states ( California , Oregon , Washington , Idaho , Alaska , and Hawaii ) still voting. All American networks called the election in favor of Obama at 11:00 PM as the polls closed on the West Coast. Obama was immediately declared the winner in California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii, McCain won Idaho, and the Electoral College totals were updated to 297 for Obama and 146 for McCain (270 are needed to win). McCain gave a concession speech half an hour later in his hometown of Phoenix, Arizona . [216] Obama appeared just before midnight Eastern Time in Grant Park , Chicago , in front of a crowd of 250,000 people to deliver his victory speech . [217]
Cartogram of the Electoral Votes for 2008 United States presidential election, each square representing one electoral vote. The map shows the impact of winning swing states . Nebraska, being one of two states that are not winner-take-all, for the first time had its votes split, with its second congressional district voting for Obama.
The voter turnout for this election was broadly predicted to be high by American standards, [221] [222] and a record number of votes were cast. [223] The final tally of total votes counted was 131.3 million, compared to 122.3 million in 2004 (which also boasted the highest record since 1968 , the last presidential election before the voting age was lowered to 18). Expressed as a percentage of eligible voters, 131.2 million votes could reflect a turnout as high as 63.0% of eligible voters, which would be the highest since 1960 . [224] [225] This 63.0% turnout rate is based on an estimated eligible voter population of 208,323,000. [225] Another estimate puts the eligible voter population at 213,313,508, resulting in a turnout rate of 61.6%, which would be the highest turnout rate since 1968. [226]
American University 's Center for the Study of the American Electorate released a report on November 6, 2008, two days after the election, which concluded that the anticipated increase in turnout had failed to materialize. [224] That report was the basis for some news articles that indicated voter turnout failed to meet expectations. [227] [228] When the remaining votes were counted after the release of the report, the total number of votes cast in the presidential election was raised to 131.2 million, which surpassed the American University report's preliminary estimate of 126.5 to 128.5 million voters by a factor of between 2% and 4%.
The election saw increased participation from African Americans , who made up 11.1% of the electorate in 2004, versus 13.0% in 2008. [229] According to exit polls, over 95% of African Americans voted for Obama. This played a critical role in southern states such as North Carolina. 74% of North Carolina's registered African American voters turned out, as opposed to 69% of North Carolinians in general, with Obama carrying 100% (with rounding) of African-American females and African Americans age 18 to 29, according to exit polling. [230] This was the case in Virginia as well where much higher turnout among African Americans propelled Obama to victory in the former Republican stronghold. [231] Even in southern states where Obama was unsuccessful, such as Georgia and Mississippi, due to large African American turnout he was much more competitive than John Kerry in 2004. [232] [233]

No other candidate had ballot access in enough states to win 270 electoral votes. All six candidates appeared on the ballot for a majority of the voters, while the 17 other listed candidates were available to no more than 30% of the voters. [235]
The following candidates (and/or parties) had ballot listing and/or write-in status in more than one state: [236]
Alan Keyes ( America's Independent Party ) received 47,746 votes; listed in three states: Colorado and Florida, plus California (listed as American Independent), and also had write-in status in Kentucky, Ohio, Texas, and Utah.
Ron Paul received 42,426 votes; listed in Louisiana (Louisiana Taxpayers) and in Montana (Constitution), with write-in status in California.
Gloria La Riva ( Party for Socialism and Liberation ) received 6,808 votes [237] nationally; listed in 12 states: Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
Brian Moore ( Socialist Party , see Brian Moore presidential campaign, 2008 ) received 6,538 votes; listed in eight states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin, and Tennessee (independent) and Vermont (Liberty Union). He also filed for write-in status in 17 other states: Alaska, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming.
Róger Calero ( Socialist Workers Party ) received 5,151 votes; listed in ten states. He was listed by name in Delaware, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont. James Harris was listed as his stand-in in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, and Washington, and also had write-in status in California.
Charles Jay ( Boston Tea Party ) received 2,422 votes; listed in Colorado and Florida, and in Tennessee (as independent), with write-in status in Arizona, Montana, and Utah.
Tom Stevens ( Objectivist ) received 755 votes; listed in Colorado and Florida.
Gene Amondson ( Prohibition ) received 653 votes; listed in Colorado, Florida, and Louisiana.
Jonathan Allen ( HeartQuake ) received 483 votes; listed only in Colorado, with write-in status in Arizona, Georgia, Montana, Texas, and other states.
The following candidates (parties) were listed on the ballot in only one state:
Richard Duncan (Independent) – Ohio; 3,905 votes.
John Joseph Polachek ( New Party ) Illinois; 1,149 votes.
George Phillies – New Hampshire (also listed with the label Libertarian); 531 votes.
In Nevada, 6,267 votes were cast for "None Of These Candidates". [238] In the three states that officially keep track of "blank" votes for President, 103,193 votes were recorded as "blank". [239] More than 100,000 write-in votes were cast and recorded for a scattering of other candidates, including 62 votes for " Santa Claus " (in ten states) and 11 votes for " Mickey Mouse " (in five states). [240]
According to the Federal Election Commission, an unusually high number of "miscellaneous" write-ins were cast for president in 2008, including 112,597 tallied in the 17 states that record votes for non-listed candidates. [241] There were more presidential candidates on the ballot than at any other time in U. S. history, except for the 1992 election , which also had 23 candidates listed in at least one state.
Popular vote totals are from the official Federal Election Commission report . The results of the electoral vote were certified by Congress on January 8, 2009. [220]

Obama, having a Caucasian mother and Kenyan father of the Luo ethnic group , [248] became the first African American as well as the first bi-racial president. [249] The Obama-Biden ticket was also the first winning ticket in American history on which neither candidate was a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant ; Biden is Roman Catholic and is the first Roman Catholic to be elected Vice President. [250] Obama and Biden were the first President and Vice President elected from the Senate since 1960 ( John F. Kennedy / Lyndon B. Johnson ), Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy, and the Obama-Biden ticket was the first winning Democratic ticket to feature two Northerners since 1940 ( Franklin D. Roosevelt / Henry A. Wallace ). Also, Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976 , the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 , and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944 .
Swing by state. States are listed by (increasing) percentage of Democratic votes, showing how the share of the vote changed between 2004 and 2008. Only five states trended more Republican: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia.
Prior to the election, commentators discussed whether Senator Obama would be able to redraw the electoral map by winning states that had been voting for Republican candidates in recent decades. [251] In many ways, he was successful. He won every region of the country by double digits except the South, which John McCain won by nine percent. Obama won Delaware , the District of Columbia , Maryland , North Carolina , Florida , and Virginia in the South (region as defined by the US Census Bureau ). McCain won most of the Deep South, where white voters have supported Republican candidates by large margins in the last few decades. [252] Obama also defied political bellwethers, becoming the first person to win the presidency while losing Missouri since 1956 (as well as the first Democrat ever to do so) and while losing Kentucky and Tennessee since 1960 . He was the first Democrat to win the presidency without winning West Virginia since 1916 and the first Democrat to win without Arkansas since that state joined the Union in 1836. Indiana and Virginia voted for the Democratic nominee for the first time since 1964 . Although Obama did not win other normally Republican states such as Georgia and Montana (which were won by Bill Clinton in 1992 ), he nonetheless was competitive in both. He lost Montana by just under 3% and Georgia by slightly more than 5%. Also notably, Barack Obama won all of the 2004 swing states (states that either Kerry or Bush won by less than 5%) by a margin of 8.5 percent or more except for Ohio, which the Democrat carried by 4.5 percent.
Obama was the first presidential candidate to split the electoral votes from Nebraska . Together with Maine , which has not yet split its electoral votes, Nebraska is one of two states that split their electoral votes, two going to the statewide popular vote winner and the rest going to the winner of each respective congressional district (Nebraska has three, and Maine has two). Obama won the electoral vote from Nebraska's 2nd congressional district , which contains the city of Omaha . Nebraska's other four electoral votes went to John McCain.
This election exhibited the continuation of some of the polarization trends evident in the 2000 and 2004 elections. [253] McCain won whites 55-43 percent, while Obama won blacks 95-4 percent, [254] Hispanics 67-31 percent, and Asians 62-35 percent. Voters aged 18–29 voted for Obama by 66–32 percent while elderly voters backed McCain 53–45 percent. [255] The 25-year age gap between McCain and Obama was the widest in U.S. presidential election history among the top two candidates. [256]
The 2008 presidential election featured the rise of data journalism in the coverage of politics. Nate Silver , of FiveThiryEight.com, correctly predicted the outcome of 49 of the 50 states and all 35 Senate races. [257]

Presidential election results map. Blue denotes states/districts won by Obama/Biden, and Red denotes those won by McCain/Palin. Numbers indicate electoral votes allotted to the winner of each state. Obama won one electoral vote (from Nebraska's 2nd congressional district) of Nebraska's five.
The United States presidential election of 2008 was the 56th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday, November 4, 2008. Democratic Party nominee Senator Barack Obama and running mate Senator Joe Biden defeated Republican Party nominee Senator John McCain and running mate Governor Sarah Palin .
McCain secured the Republican nomination by March 2008, but the Democratic nomination was marked by a sharp contest between Obama and initial frontrunner Senator Hillary Clinton , with Obama not securing the nomination until early June. Early campaigning had focused heavily on the Iraq War and the unpopularity of outgoing Republican President George W. Bush , but all candidates focused on domestic concerns as well, which grew more prominent as the economy experienced the onset of the Great Recession and a major financial crisis that peaked in September 2008 .
Obama would go on to win a decisive victory over McCain, winning both the popular vote and the electoral college , with 365 electoral votes to McCain's 173; he received the largest percentage of the popular vote for a Democrat in nearly a half-century . Obama's successes in obtaining a major party's nomination and winning the general election were both firsts for an African American . Although Hillary Clinton did not win the Democratic nomination, she was the first woman to win a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection when she won the primary in New Hampshire on January 8. [2] [3] [nb 1] She also was the first woman to be an American presidential candidate in every primary and caucus in every state. [6] Similarly, Sarah Palin became the first woman to appear on a Republican presidential ticket, and the second woman overall to appear on a major party's presidential ticket (after Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 ).
This was notable as the first election since 1952 where neither of the two major candidates were either the incumbent president or vice president. Obama's total vote amount of 69.5 million votes is the highest amount ever won by a presidential candidate. The total of 131 million votes cast in the election represents over 43% of the total U.S. population, the highest share of any presidential election in U.S. history. [7] [8]

In 2004 , President George W. Bush won reelection , defeating the Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry . After Republican pickups in the House and Senate in the 2004 elections, Republicans maintained control of the executive and legislative branches of the federal government.
Bush's approval ratings had been slowly declining from their high point of almost 90% after 9/11 , [9] and they were barely 50% by his reelection. Although Bush was reelected with a larger Electoral College margin than in 2000 , during his second term, Bush's approval rating dropped more quickly, with the Iraq War and the federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 being most detrimental to the public's perception of his job performance. [10] [11]
By September 2006, Bush's approval rating was below 40%, [12] and in the November United States Congressional elections 2006 , Democrats gained the majority in both houses. Bush's approval ratings dropped for the last two years in office to the 25–37% range. [13] [14] [15]
In the United States, there are two major political parties , the Democratic Party and the Republican Party . There are also several minor parties, usually called third parties, though most media and public focus is on the two major parties.
Each major party hosts candidates who go through a nomination process to determine the presidential nominee for that party. The nomination process consists of primaries and caucuses, held by the 50 states, as well as Guam , Puerto Rico , Washington, D.C. , U.S. Virgin Islands , American Samoa , and the Northern Mariana Islands . The winner of each of these primary elections usually receives delegates proportional to the percentage of the popular vote that candidate received in each states. In many Republican primaries, all the state's delegates are awarded to the winning candidate. In the Democratic Party, high-ranking party members known as superdelegates each receive one vote in the convention. Whichever candidate has the majority of the delegates at the end of the primary elections is designated the presumptive nominee until he or she is formally nominated and endorsed for the presidency by his or her political party. This is done by the aforementioned delegates for each party.

Before the primaries[ edit ]
Media speculation had begun almost immediately after the results of the 2004 presidential elections became known. In the 2006 midterm elections , the Democrats regained majorities in both houses of Congress . [16] Early polls taken before anyone had announced a candidacy had shown Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as the most popular potential Democratic candidates. [17] Nevertheless, the media speculated on several other candidates, including Al Gore , the runner-up in the 2000 election ; John Kerry , the runner-up in the 2004 election ; John Edwards , his running mate ; Delaware Senator Joseph Biden; New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson; Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack; and Indiana Senator Evan Bayh. [18]
Edwards was one of the first to formally announce his candidacy for the presidency, on December 28, 2006. This run would be his second attempt at the presidency. [19] Clinton announced intentions to run in the Democratic primaries on January 20, 2007. [20] Obama announced his candidacy on February 10 in his home state of Illinois. [20] None of the candidates received a significant bounce in their poll numbers after their official announcements. [21] Through most of 2007, even after it was evident Al Gore would not run, John Edwards and Al Gore each hovered between the third and fourth place spots in the polls behind Clinton and Obama. [22]
"Front-runner" status is dependent on the news agency reporting, and by October 2007, the consensus listed the three aforementioned candidates as leading the pack after several debate performances. The Washington Post listed Clinton, Edwards and Obama as the front runners, "leading in polls and fundraising and well ahead of the other major candidates". [23] Clinton led in nearly all nationwide opinion polling until January 2008. [22]
Comedian Stephen Colbert mounted his own campaign for the nomination in his home state of South Carolina , announcing it in October 2007. [24] Public Opinion Strategies conducted a poll and found Colbert nationally in fifth place at 2.3% behind Joe Biden's 2.7%. [25]
The early primaries and caucuses are considered the most critical of nomination process. Most candidates lacking support drop out after doing poorly in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary , and these states' results often shift national preferences, according to historical polling data. [26] The states that hold early primaries and caucuses are, chronologically, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. In 2008, Florida and Michigan moved their primaries into January against the Democratic Party's rules, and the results of these primaries were discounted and disputed until after the rest of the contests occurred. [27]
At the start of the year, support for Barack Obama began rising in the polls, passing Clinton for first place in Iowa; Obama ended up winning the Iowa caucus, with John Edwards coming in second and Clinton in third. [28] Obama's win was fueled mostly by first time caucus-goers and Independents and showed voters viewed him as the candidate of change. [28] Iowa is viewed as the state that jump-started Obama's campaign and set him on track to win the nomination and the presidency. [29] After the Iowa caucus, Joe Biden and Christopher Dodd withdrew from the nomination contest. [28]
Obama became the new front runner in New Hampshire when his poll numbers skyrocketed after his victory in Iowa. [30] The Clinton campaign was struggling after a bad loss in Iowa and no strategy beyond the early primaries and caucuses. According to The Vancouver Sun , "Campaign strategists had mapped a victory scenario that envisioned the former first lady wrapping up the Democratic presidential nomination by Super Tuesday on Feb. 5." [31] In what is considered a turning point for her campaign, Clinton had a strong performance at the Saint Anselm College , ABC and Facebook debates several days before the New Hampshire primary as well as an emotional interview in a public broadcast live on TV. [32] Clinton won that primary by 2% of the vote, contrary to the predictions of pollsters who consistently had her trailing Obama for a few days up to the primary date. [30] Clinton's win was the first time a woman had ever won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. [33] (Shirley Chisholm's prior "win" in New Jersey in 1972 was in a no-delegate-awarding, presidential preference ballot that the major candidates were not listed in and that the only other candidate who was listed had already withdrawn from; the actual delegate selection vote went to George McGovern . [34] [35] )
On January 30, 2008, after placing in third in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, Edwards announced that he was suspending his campaign for the presidency, but he did not initially endorse any remaining candidate. [36] [37]
Super Tuesday occurred on February 5, 2008, during which the largest-ever number of simultaneous state primary elections was held. [38] Super Tuesday ended up leaving the Democrats in a virtual tie, with Obama amassing 847 delegates to Clinton's 834 from the 23 states that held Democratic primaries. [39]
Earlier, on February 3 on the UCLA campus, celebrities Oprah Winfrey , Caroline Kennedy and Stevie Wonder , among others, made appearances to show support for Barack Obama in a rally led by Michelle Obama . [40] In addition, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger 's wife at the time, Maria Shriver , endorsed Obama. [41] California was one of the Super Tuesday states that were rich in delegates. Obama trailed in the California polling by an average of 6.0% before the primary; he ended up losing the state by 8.3%. [42] Some analysts cited a large Latino turnout that voted for Clinton as the deciding factor. [43]
Louisiana , Nebraska , Hawaii , Wisconsin , U.S. Virgin Islands , the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia primaries and the Washington and Maine caucuses all took place after Super Tuesday in February. Obama won all of them, giving him ten consecutive victories after Super Tuesday. [44] [45]
Ohio, Texas, and Pennsylvania[ edit ]
On March 4, Hillary Clinton carried Ohio and Rhode Island in the Democratic primaries; some considered these wins, especially Ohio, a surprise upset, [46] although she led in the polling averages in both states. [42] [47] She also carried the primary in Texas , but Obama won the Texas caucuses held the same day and netted more delegates from the state than Clinton. [48]
Only one state held a primary in April. This was Pennsylvania , on April 22. Although Obama made a strong effort to win Pennsylvania, Hillary Clinton won the primary by nearly 10%, with approximately 55% of the vote. [49] Obama had outspent Clinton three to one in Pennsylvania, but his comment at a San Francisco fundraiser that small-town Americans "cling" to guns and religion drew sharp criticism from the Clinton campaign and may have hurt his chances in the Keystone State. [50] In addition, Clinton had several advantages in Pennsylvania. Throughout the primary process, she relied on the support of older, white, working class voters. Pennsylvania held a closed primary, which means that only registered Democrats could vote, and, according to Ron Elving of NPR , "The established Democratic electorate was older, whiter, more Catholic and more working-class than in most of the primaries to date." [51] After Pennsylvania, Obama had a higher number of delegates and popular votes than Clinton did and was still in a stronger position to win the nomination. Clinton, however, had received the endorsement of more superdelegates than Obama. [49]
Indiana and North Carolina[ edit ]
On May 6, North Carolina and Indiana held their Democratic presidential primaries. Clinton and Obama campaigned aggressively there before the voting took place. The candidates acknowledged the importance of these primaries and said they were turning point states that could make or break either of their campaigns. [52] Polling had shown Obama a few points ahead in North Carolina and Clinton similarly leading in Indiana. [53] [54] In the actual results, Obama outperformed the polls by several points in both states, winning by a significant margin in North Carolina [55] and losing by only 1.1% in Indiana (50.56% to 49.44%). [56] After these primaries, most pundits declared that it had become increasingly improbable, if not impossible, for Clinton to win the nomination. [57] The small win in Indiana barely kept her campaign alive for the next month. [58] Although she did manage to win the majority of the remaining primaries and delegates, it was not enough to overcome Obama's substantial delegate lead.
Scandal surrounded the primary in Indiana because a Democratic State Committee member and county chair led a forgery ring to get all of the Democratic candidates on the ballot. [59] This Democratic State Committee member, Owen "Butch" Morgan was convicted of felonies regarding the forgeries and sentenced to a year in prison, community corrections, and probation. [60]
All Democratic presidential candidates needed, under Indiana law, 500 signatures per congressional district. Owen "Butch" Morgan, Democrat county chair, congressional district chair, and State Committee member, was convicted as the leader. Congressional candidate Andrew Straw [61] called on Morgan to resign in May 2011 over inaccessibility of the Democratic headquarters in South Bend, but he resigned instead over the petition forgery indictment. [62] [63] Straw is now the state chair of the Disability Party in Indiana. [64]
Florida and Michigan[ edit ]
During late 2007, the two parties adopted rules against states' moving their primaries to an earlier date in the year. For the Republicans, the penalty for this violation was supposed to be the loss of half the state party's delegates to the convention. The Democratic penalty was the complete exclusion from the national convention of delegates from states that broke these rules. The Democratic Party allowed only four states to hold elections before February 5, 2008. Initially, the Democratic leadership said it would strip all delegates from Florida and Michigan , which had moved their primaries into January. In addition, all major Democratic candidates agreed officially not to campaign in Florida or Michigan, and Edwards and Obama removed their names from the Michigan ballot. Clinton won a majority of delegates and popular votes from both states (though 40% voted uncommitted in Michigan) and subsequently led a fight to seat all the Florida and Michigan delegates. [65]
Political columnist Christopher Weber noted that while her action was self-serving, it was also pragmatic to forestall Florida or Michigan voters becoming so disaffected they did not vote for Democrats in the general election. [66] There was some speculation that the fight over the delegates could last until the convention in August. On May 31, 2008, the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic Party reached a compromise on the Florida and Michigan delegate situation. The committee decided to seat delegates from Michigan and Florida at the convention in August, but to only award each a half-vote. [67]
Clinching the nomination[ edit ]
Technically the nomination process for major political parties continues through June of election year. In previous cycles the candidates were effectively chosen by the end of the March primaries. In this cycle, Barack Obama did not win enough delegates to secure the nomination until June 3, after a 17-month-long campaign against Hillary Clinton. Obama had a wide lead in states won, while Clinton had won majorities in several of the larger states. Because a form of proportional representation and popular vote decided Democratic state delegate contests, numbers were close between Clinton and Obama. [68] By May, Clinton claimed to hold a lead in the popular vote, but the Associated Press found her numbers accurate only in one close scenario. [69]
In June, after the last of the primaries had taken place, Obama secured the Democratic nomination for President, with the help of multiple super delegate endorsements (most of the super delegates had refused to declare their support for either candidate until the primaries were completed). [70] He was the first African American to win the nomination of a major political party in the United States. [71] For several days, Clinton refused to concede the race, although she signaled her presidential campaign was ending in a post-primary speech on June 3 in her home state of New York. [72] She finally conceded the nomination to Obama on June 7. She pledged her full support to the presumptive nominee and vowed to do everything she could to help him get elected. [73]

Before the primaries[ edit ]
Immediately after the 2006 midterm elections, media pundits began speculating, as they did about the Democrats, about potential Republican candidates for President in 2008. [17] In November 2006, Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led in the polls, followed closely by Arizona Senator John McCain . [76] The media speculated that Giuliani's pro-choice stance on abortion and McCain's age and support of the unpopular Iraq War would be detriments to their candidacies. [17] Giuliani remained the frontrunner in the polls throughout most of 2007, with McCain and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson fighting for second place. [77] Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee , Giuliani, Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney , and Texas Congressman Ron Paul announced their candidacies on January 28, February 5, February 13, and March 12, respectively. [78] [79] [80] [81] McCain officially announced his candidacy on March 1, 2007, after several informal announcements. [82] In the third quarter of 2007, the top four GOP (Republican) fundraisers were Romney, Giuliani, Thompson, and Ron Paul . [83] MSNBC's Chuck Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the front runners after the second Republican presidential debate in early 2007. [84]
Huckabee, after winning in Iowa, had little money and hoped for a third-place finish in New Hampshire. McCain eventually displaced Rudy Giuliani and Romney as the front runner in New Hampshire . McCain staged a turnaround victory, [85] having been written off by the pundits and polling in single digits less than a month before the race. [86]
With the Republicans stripping Michigan and Florida of half their delegates for moving their primaries into January 2008 against party rules, the race for the nomination was based there. McCain meanwhile managed a small victory over Huckabee in South Carolina , [87] setting him up for a larger and more important victory over Romney in Florida , which held a closed primary on January 29. [88] By this time, after several scandals, no success in the early primaries, and a third-place finish in Florida, Giuliani conceded from the nomination race and endorsed John McCain the next day. [89]
McCain was also endorsed in February by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger before the California primary took place on Super Tuesday. This gave him a significant boost in the polls for the state's primary, [90] which awarded the greatest number of delegates of all the states. On Super Tuesday, McCain won his home state of Arizona, taking all 53 delegates. He also won nearly all of California's 173 delegates, the largest of the Super Tuesday prizes. McCain also scored wins in seven other states, picking up 574 delegates. [91] Huckabee was the "surprise performer", winning 5 states and 218 delegates. [91] Romney won 7 states and 231 delegates. [91] Two days later, Romney suspended his presidential campaign, saying that if he stayed in the race, he would "forestall the launch of a national campaign and be making it easier for Senator Clinton or Obama to win". [92] His departure left Huckabee and Paul as McCain's only major challengers in the remaining primaries and caucuses. Romney endorsed McCain on February 14. [93]
Louisiana, Washington, Kansas , Wisconsin , and Washington held primaries in February after Super Tuesday. Despite McCain picking up big victories, Huckabee won Louisiana and Kansas. McCain narrowly carried the Washington caucuses over Huckabee and Paul, who amassed a large showing. [45] The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico closed February for the Republicans. After Super Tuesday, John McCain had become the clear front runner, but by the end of February, he still had not acquired enough delegates to secure the nomination. In March, John McCain clinched the Republican nomination after sweeping all four primaries, Texas , Ohio , Vermont , and Rhode Island , putting him over the top of the 1,191 delegates required to win the GOP nomination. [47] Mike Huckabee then conceded the race to McCain, leaving Ron Paul, who had just 16 delegates, as his only remaining opponent. [94]
Along with the Democratic and Republican parties, three other parties nominated candidates with ballot access in enough states to win the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. These were the Constitution Party , the Green Party , and the Libertarian Party . In addition, independent candidate Ralph Nader ran his own campaign.
The Green Party nominated former Democratic Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney of Georgia for President, and political activist Rosa Clemente from New York for Vice President. McKinney campaigned on a platform that supported single-payer universal health care , the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, reparations for African Americans, and the creation of a Department of Peace. [98]
The Libertarian Party nominated former Republican Congressman Bob Barr of Georgia for President, and his former rival for the Libertarian nomination Wayne Allyn Root of Nevada, for Vice President. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Barr advocated a reworking or abolishment of the income tax [99] and opposed the war in Iraq [100] and the Patriot Act . [101]
Sites of the 2008 National Party Conventions
General election campaign[ edit ]
An issue in the election was Obama's possible, [102] [103] [104] and then actual, [105] [106] nomination by the Democratic Party. On August 28, 2008, when Obama formally accepted the Democratic nomination for President, he became the first African American to be nominated for President by a major political party. [105] The television audiences for both McCain's and Obama's acceptance speeches broke records, according to Nielsen ratings . [107]
The unpopular war in Iraq was a key issue during the campaign before the economic crisis . John McCain supported the war while Barack Obama opposed it. (Obama's early and strong opposition to the war helped him stand out against the other Democratic candidates during the primaries, as well as stand out to a war-weary electorate during the general campaign). Though McCain meant it as a peacetime presence like the United States maintained in Germany and Japan after World War II , [108] his statement that the United States could be in Iraq for as much as the next 50 to 100 years would prove costly. Obama used it against him as part of his strategy to tie him to the unpopular President Bush.
John McCain's support for the troop 'surge' employed by General David Petraeus , which was one of several factors credited with improving the security situation in Iraq, may have boosted McCain's stance on the issue in voters' minds. McCain (who supported the invasion) argued that his support for the successful surge showed his superior judgment. However, Obama was quick to remind voters that there would have been no need for a "surge" had there been no war at all, thus questioning McCain's judgment.
George W. Bush had become increasingly unpopular by 2006. Polls consistently showed that about 30 percent of the American public approved of his job performance. [13] [109] [110] In March 2008, Bush endorsed McCain at the White House, [111] but Bush did not make a single appearance for McCain during the campaign. Bush appeared at the 2008 GOP convention only through a live video broadcast. He chose not to appear in person due to disaster events in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav . Although he supported the war in Iraq, McCain made an effort to show that he had disagreed with Bush on many other key issues such as climate change. During the entire general election campaign, Obama countered by pointing out in ads and at numerous campaign rallies that McCain had claimed in an interview that he voted with Bush 90% of the time, and congressional voting records supported this for the years Bush was in office. [112]
Change vs. experience[ edit ]
Before the Democratic primaries began, the dichotomy of change versus experience had already become a common theme in the presidential campaign, with Senator Hillary Clinton positioning herself as the candidate with experience and Obama embracing the characterization as the candidate most able to bring change to Washington. Before the official launch of her campaign , aides for Clinton were already planning to position her as the 'change' candidate, as strategist Mark Penn made clear in an October 2006 memo titled "The Plan." [113] In his presidential run announcement, Obama framed his candidacy by emphasizing that "Washington must change." [114] In response to this, Clinton adopted her experience as a major campaign theme. [115] By early and mid-2007, polls regularly found voters identifying Clinton as the more experienced candidate and Obama as the "fresh" or "new" candidate. [116] [117] Exit polls on Super Tuesday found that Obama won voters who thought that the ability to bring change was the most important quality in a candidate, who made up a majority of the Democratic electorate. By a margin of about 2-1, Clinton was able to make up for this deficiency by an almost total domination among voters who thought experience was the most important quality. [118] These margins generally remained the same until Obama clinched the Democratic nomination on June 3.
Obama campaigning as a symbol of change in Cleveland , Ohio with a "Change We Need" sign
Obama's promised "universal health care, full employment, a green America, and an America respected instead of feared by its enemies". [119] He used new media to "form a bond with his supporters" which helped him "appeal to the youth audience's need to feel special, in-the-know, empowered and special". This was best displayed in his text message announcement of Joe Biden as the vice-presidential candidate. [120] He has also declared, in his book The Audacity of Hope , that he did not experience a religious upbringing. Rather he developed his faith due to the church's ability to motivate social change. [121] Bowdern wrote, "This is best exemplified in his "50 state strategy", where he campaigned in states that historically would never vote for a Democrat. The 2008 presidential election saw a large youth turn out, up to 51%." [122]
John McCain quickly adopted similar campaign themes against Obama at the start of the general election campaign. Polls regularly found the general electorate as a whole divided more evenly between 'change' and 'experience' as candidate qualities than the Democratic primary electorate, which split in favor of 'change' by a nearly 2-1 margin. [123] Advantages for McCain and Obama on experience and the ability to bring change, respectively, remained steady through the November 4 election. However, final pre-election polling found that voters considered Obama's inexperience less of an impediment than McCain's association with sitting President George W. Bush, [124] an association which was rhetorically framed by the Obama campaign throughout the election season as "more of the same".
McCain appeared to undercut his line of attack by picking first-term Alaska governor Sarah Palin to be his running mate. [125] Palin had been governor only since 2006, and before that had been a council member and mayor of Wasilla . Nonetheless, she excited much of the conservative base of the GOP with her speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention , a group that was initially lukewarm toward McCain's candidacy. [126] However, media interviews suggested that Palin lacked knowledge on certain key issues, and they cast doubt among many voters about her qualifications to be Vice President or President. [127] Because of Palin's conservative views, there was also concern that she would alienate independents and moderates, two groups that pundits observed McCain would need to win the election. [128]
Polls taken in the last few months of the presidential campaign and exit polls conducted on Election Day showed the economy as the top concern for voters. [129] [130] In the fall of 2008, many news sources were reporting that the economy was suffering its most serious downturn since the Great Depression . [131] During this period, John McCain's election prospects fell with several politically costly comments about the economy.
On August 20, John McCain said in an interview with Politico that he was uncertain how many houses he and his wife, Cindy, owned; "I think—I'll have my staff get to you." [132] Both on the stump and in Obama's political ad, "Seven", the gaffe was used to portray McCain as unable to relate to the concerns of ordinary Americans. This out-of-touch image was further cultivated when, on September 15, the day of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy , at a morning rally in Jacksonville, Florida, McCain declared that "the fundamentals of our economy are strong," despite what he described as "tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and Wall Street." [133] With the perception among voters to the contrary, the comment appeared to cost McCain politically.
On September 24, 2008, after the onset of the 2008 financial crisis , McCain announced that he was suspending his campaign to return to Washington to help craft a $700 billion bailout package for the troubled financial industry, and he stated that he would not debate Obama until Congress passed the bailout bill. [134] Despite this decision, McCain was portrayed as not playing a significant role in the negotiations for the first version of the bill, which fell short of passage in the House. He eventually decided to attend the first presidential debate on September 26, despite Congress' lack of immediate action on the bill. His ineffectiveness in the negotiations and his reversal in decision to attend the debates were seized upon to portray McCain as erratic in his response to the economy. Days later, a second version of the original bailout bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with Obama, his vice presidential running mate Joe Biden , and McCain all voting for the measure (Hillary Clinton would as well). [135]
All the aforementioned remarks and campaign issues hurt McCain's standing with voters. All these also occurred after the economic crisis and after McCain's poll numbers had started to fall. Although sound bites of all of these "missteps" were played repeatedly on national television, many pundits and analysts say that the actual financial crisis and economic conditions caused McCain's large drop in support in mid-September and severely damaged his campaign. [136] [137]
John McCain 's proposals focused on open-market competition rather than government funding or control. At the heart of his plan were tax credits – $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families who do not subscribe to or do not have access to health care through their employer. To help people who are denied coverage by insurance companies due to pre-existing conditions, McCain proposed working with states to create what he calls a "Guaranteed Access Plan". [138]
Barack Obama called for universal health care . His health care plan proposed creating a National Health Insurance Exchange that would include both private insurance plans and a Medicare-like government run option. Coverage would be guaranteed regardless of health status, and premiums would not vary based on health status either. It would have required parents to cover their children, but did not require adults to buy insurance.
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the two plans had different philosophical focuses. They described the purpose of the McCain plan as to "make insurance more affordable," while the purpose of the Obama plan was for "more people to have health insurance." [139] The Des Moines Register characterized the plans similarly. [140] The Commonwealth Fund concluded that, compared with McCain's approach, Obama's plan could provide more people with affordable health insurance that covers essential services, achieve greater equity in access to care, realize efficiencies and cost savings in the provision of coverage and delivery of care, and redirect incentives to improve quality. [141]
Critics of McCain's plan argued that it would not significantly reduce the number of uninsured Americans, would increase costs, reduce consumer protections and lead to less generous benefit packages. [142] Critics of Obama's plan argued that it would increase federal regulation of private health insurance without addressing the underlying incentives behind rising health care spending. [143] [144] Mark Pauly suggested that a combination of the two approaches would work better than either one alone. [145]
Various analyses of the two candidates' plans came to widely varying predictions of their costs and effects. A comparison by The Tax Policy Center, a project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute estimated that Obama's proposals could cost $1.6 trillion over 10 years, while the tax-related provisions of McCain's proposals could cost $1.3 trillion over the same period. A comparison by The Lewin Group, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group , published in October 2008, found that the McCain plan would reduce the number of uninsured by 21.1 million and cost $2.05 trillion over 10 years, while the Obama plan would reduce the uninsured by 26.6 million and increase federal spending by $1.17 trillion over the same period. [146] Estimates prepared by HSI Networks found that the McCain plan would reduce the uninsured by 27.5 million at an annual cost of $287 billion, [147] and the Obama plan would reduce the uninsured by 25.5 million at an annual cost of $452 billion. [148]
A poll released in early November 2008, found that voters supporting Obama listed health care as their second priority; voters supporting McCain listed it as fourth, tied with the war in Iraq. Affordability was the primary health care priority among both sets of voters. Obama voters were more likely than McCain voters to believe government can do much about health care costs. [149]
In an October 17–20, 2008, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of registered voters, 2% said race made them more likely to vote for Barack Obama, 4% said it made them less likely to do so, and 2% were not sure. The other 92% of respondents said race was not a major factor in their vote. (margin of error was ±2.9%). [150]
A July 18–21, 2008, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed that 20% of African American registered voters and 8% of white registered voters considered race the single most important factor when voting (margin of error was ±3.1%). This percentage increased in both groups from previous polls. [151]
A June 6–9, 2008, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed that 17% were enthusiastic about Obama being the first African American president, 70% were comfortable or indifferent, and 13% had reservations or were uncomfortable (margin of error was ±3.1%). [152]
Obama generally avoided racial issues in his campaign. He would often place white people behind him when in a hall speaking to a large black group in order to avoid racial imagery. [153] On June 11, 2008, Fox News Channel used the phrase "Outraged liberals: Stop picking on Obama's baby mama " in an on screen graphic in a discussion as to whether U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama 's wife, Michelle , was being unfairly criticized. A senior vice president of programming at Fox said in a statement that a producer "exercised poor judgment" during the segment. [154] There were also attempts to interpret a fist tap as either a racial move, or a "terrorist fist jab". [155]
September 26: The first presidential debate took place at the University of Mississippi . The central issues debated were supposed to be foreign policy and national security. However, due to the economic climate, some questions appeared on this topic. The debate was formatted into nine nine-minute segments, and the moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS , introduced the topics. [157]
October 7: The second presidential debate took place at Belmont University . It was a town meeting format debate moderated by NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw , and addressed issues raised by members of the audience, particularly the economy . [159]
October 15: The third and final presidential debate was hosted at Hofstra University . It focused on domestic and economic policy. Like the first presidential debate, it was formatted into segments, with moderator Bob Schieffer introducing the topics. [159]
Another debate was sponsored by the Columbia University political union and took place there on October 19. All candidates who could theoretically win the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election were invited, and Ralph Nader , Cynthia McKinney , and Chuck Baldwin agreed to attend. Amy Goodman , principal host of Democracy Now! , moderated. It was broadcast on cable by C-SPAN and on the Internet by Break-the-Matrix. [160]
The reported cost of campaigning for president has increased significantly in recent years. One source reported that if the costs for both Democratic and Republican campaigns were added together (for the presidential primary election, general election, and the political conventions), the costs have more than doubled in only eight years ($448.9 million in 1996, $649.5 million in 2000, and $1.01 billion in 2004). [161] In January 2007, Federal Election Commission Chairman Michael E. Toner estimated that the 2008 race would be a $1 billion election, and that to be taken seriously, a candidate would have needed to raise at least $100 million by the end of 2007. [162]
Although he had said he would not be running for president, published reports in 2007 indicated that billionaire and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg had been considering a presidential bid as an independent with up to $1 billion of his own fortune to finance it. [163] Bloomberg ultimately ended this speculation by unequivocally stating that he would not run. [164]
With the increase in money expenditures, many candidates did not use the public financing system funded by the presidential election campaign fund checkoff . John McCain, [165] Tom Tancredo, [166] John Edwards, [167] Chris Dodd, [168] and Joe Biden [169] qualified for and elected to take public funds throughout the primary process. Major Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama chose not to participate in the public financing system. [170]
According to required campaign filings as reported by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), 148 candidates for all parties collectively raised $1,644,712,232 and spent $1,601,104,696 for the primary and general campaigns combined through November 24, 2008. The amounts raised and spent by the major candidates, according to the same source, were as follows:

Notable expressions and phrases[ edit ]
That One : McCain's reference to Obama during the 2nd debate.
Lipstick on a pig : Obama used this phrase to insinuate that any changes that McCain was advocating from the policies of George W. Bush would only be slight modifications of Bush's policies but the underlying policies would be the same, and in Obama's opinion, bad. Some Republicans called it sexism, claiming it was a reference to Sarah Palin, who cracked a joke during the Republican convention that the only difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is lipstick. [172]
Howard Dean collected large contributions through the Internet in his 2004 primary run. In 2008, candidates went even further to reach out to Internet users through their own sites and such sites as YouTube , MySpace , and Facebook . [173] [174]
On December 16, 2007, Ron Paul collected $6 million , more money on a single day through Internet donations than any presidential candidate in US history. [175] [176] [177]
Not only did the Internet allow candidates to raise money, but also it gave them a tool to appeal to newer and younger demographics. Political pundits were now evaluating candidates based on their social media following. Senator Barack Obama's victory is credited to his competitive edge in social media and Internet following. Obama had over 2 million American supporters on Facebook and 100,000 followers on Twitter , while McCain attracted only 600,000 Facebook supporters (likes) and 4,600 followers on Twitter. Obama's YouTube channel held 115,000 subscribers and more than 97 million video views. Obama had maintained a similar advantage over Senator Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Primary. [178]
Obama's edge in social media was crucial to the election outcome. According to a study by the Pew Internet and American Life project, 35 percent of Americans relied on online video for election news. Ten percent of Americans used social networking sites to learn about the election. [179] The 2008 election showed huge increases in Internet use.
Another study done after the election gave a lot of insight on young voters. Thirty-seven percent of Americans ages 18–24 got election news from social networking sites. Almost a quarter of Americans saw something about the election in an online video. [180] YouTube and other online video outlets allowed candidates to advertise in ways like never before.
Social media allowed voters to share their voting experience. On November 5, 2008 at 10:30 p.m., 4.9 million Facebook users had already posted an announcement that they had voted, simply by checking a box on the site. Various websites allowed voters to share concerns over voting malfunctions, ballot shortages and other problems. Social media and the Internet provided a new and interactive voting experience. [181]
Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama created a broad popular movement and a new method of campaigning by courting and mobilizing activists, donations, and voters through the Internet. It was part of a campaign that mobilized grassroots workers in every state. Obama also set fundraising records in more than one month by gaining support from a record-breaking number of individual small donors. [182]
Anonymous and semi-anonymous smear campaigns , traditionally done with fliers and push calling , also spread to the Internet. [183] Organizations specializing in the production and distribution of viral material, such as Brave New Films , emerged; such organizations have been said to be having a growing influence on American politics. [184]
YouTube was considered to be a valuable asset for free advertising. Joe Trippi, the manager of Howard Dean's presidential campaign, claimed that Obama's YouTube campaign material was watched for 14.5 million hours, a viewing that would have cost $47 million for broadcast television. [180] YouTube and other online video outlets allowed candidates to advertise in ways like never before.
The percentage of Americans who regularly rely on the Internet for campaign news almost doubled (13 to 24 percent) from 2004 to 2008, according to a 2008 study from the Pew Research Center. The percentage of Americans who relied on traditional news sources was either stagnant or declining. [185]
A 2011 study by Ad Age magazine shows that 39 percent of voting-age social media users repost and share political messages. The study also recorded 1/3 of Facebook friends opening video or article links. The 2008 election was a catalyst for Internet use in American politics. Jay Samit, a writer at Ad Age magazine, predicted the 2012 election to be "the most participatory election in our nation's history" because of social media. [186]
Some pre-election controversies in the election revolved around challenges to voter registration lists, involving techniques such as caging lists alleged to constitute voter suppression .
Allegations of voter list purges using unlawful criteria caused controversy in at least six swing states : Colorado , Indiana , Ohio , Michigan , Nevada and North Carolina . [187] On October 5, 2008 the Republican Lt. Governor of Montana, John Bohlinger , accused the Montana Republican Party of vote caging to purge 6,000 voters from three counties which trend Democratic. [188] Allegations arose in Michigan that the Republican Party planned to challenge the eligibility of voters based on lists of foreclosed homes. [189] The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama filed a lawsuit challenging this. The House Judiciary Committee wrote to the Department of Justice requesting an investigation. [190]
Virginia election authorities were ordered by a federal judge to preserve late-arriving absentee ballots sent by active-duty military personnel following a suit by the McCain campaign. It alleged that the state sent absentee ballots late to service members. [191] According to federal law, absentee ballots must be mailed to troops in foreign countries at least 45 days before an election. The charge against Virginia was that the ballots were not printed until after the deadline and therefore were mailed late to soldiers abroad. [192]
Guam 's 173,000 residents are U.S. citizens, and must obey U.S. laws passed in Washington, yet they have neither a voting member of Congress, nor votes in the Electoral College. [193] Since 1980, they have held a straw poll for president at the same time as the U.S. national elections. In 2007, Guam's legislature voted to move the straw poll up to September to draw attention to the choices of Guam's population and their continued disfranchisement, [193] but the governor vetoed the bill. [194] Obama won the 2008 Guam straw poll with 20,120 votes to McCain's 11,940. [195]
Libertarian candidate Bob Barr filed a lawsuit in Texas to have Obama and McCain removed from the ballot in that state. [196] His campaign alleged that both the candidates had missed the August 26 deadline to file, and were present on the ballot contrary to Texas election law. Neither candidate at the time of the deadline had been confirmed as the candidate for their respective parties. The Texas Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit without explanation. [197]
In Ohio , identified by both parties as a key state, allegations surfaced from both Republicans and Democrats that individuals from out of state were moving to the state temporarily and attempting to vote despite not meeting the state's requirement of permanent residency for more than 29 days. The Franklin County Board of Elections referred 55 cases of possible voting irregularities to the local prosecutor. [198] Three groups attracted particular notice: 'Vote from Home,' 'Vote Today Ohio,' and 'Drop Everything and Come to Ohio.' Vote from Home attracted the most attention when thirteen of the group's members moved to the same location in eastern Columbus. Members of the group organized by Marc Gustafson, including several Marshall and Rhodes scholars studying at Oxford University , settled with Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien to have their challenged ballots withdrawn. [199] [200] [201] [202] The Obama campaign and others alleged that members of the McCain campaign had also voted without properly establishing residency. [198] Since 1953, only six people in Ohio have gone to prison for illegal voting. [203]
Republicans leveled significant criticism at media outlets' coverage of the presidential election season. An October 22, 2008 Pew Research Center poll estimated 70% of registered voters believed journalists wanted Barack Obama to win the election, as opposed to 9% for John McCain. [204] Another Pew survey, conducted after the election, found that 67% of voters thought that the press fairly covered Obama, versus 30% who viewed the coverage as unfair. Regarding McCain, 53% of voters viewed his press coverage as fair versus 44% who characterized it as unfair. Among affiliated Democrats, 83% believed the press fairly covered Obama; just 22% of Republicans thought the press was fair to McCain. [205]
At the February debate, Tim Russert of NBC News was criticized for what some perceived as disproportionately tough questioning of Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton . [206] Among the questions, Russert had asked Clinton, but not Obama, to provide the name of the new Russian President ( Dmitry Medvedev ). [206] This was later parodied on Saturday Night Live . In October 2007, liberal commentators accused Russert of harassing Clinton over the issue of supporting drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants . [207]
On April 16, ABC News hosted a debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . Moderators Charles Gibson and George Stephanopoulos were criticized by viewers, bloggers and media critics for the poor quality of their questions. [206] [207] Many viewers said they considered some of the questions irrelevant when measured against the importance of the faltering economy or the Iraq war . Included in that category were continued questions about Obama's former pastor, Senator Hillary Clinton's assertion that she had to duck sniper fire in Bosnia more than a decade ago, and Senator Obama's not wearing an American flag pin. [206] The moderators focused on campaign gaffes and some believed they focused too much on Obama. [207] Stephanopoulos defended their performance, saying "Senator Obama was the front-runner" and the questions were "not inappropriate or irrelevant at all." [206] [207]
In an op-ed published on 2008 April 27 in The New York Times , Elizabeth Edwards wrote that the media covered much more of "the rancor of the campaign" and "amount of money spent" than "the candidates' priorities, policies and principles." [208] Author Erica Jong commented that "our press has become a sea of triviality, meanness and irrelevant chatter." [209] A Gallup poll released on May 29, 2008 also estimated that more Americans felt the media was being harder on Hillary Clinton than they were towards Barack Obama. [210]
The Project for Excellence in Journalism and Harvard University's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy conducted a study of 5,374 media narratives and assertions about the presidential candidates from January 1 through March 9, 2008. The study found that Obama received 69% favorable coverage and Clinton received 67%, compared to only 43% favorable media coverage of McCain. [211] Another study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University found the media coverage of Obama to be 72% negative from June 8 to July 21 compared to 57% negative for McCain. [212] An October 29 study found 29% of stories about Obama to be negative, compared to 57% of stories about McCain being negative. [213]

Election Day was on November 4, 2008. The majority of states allowed early voting, with all states allowing some form of absentee voting. [214] Voters cast votes for listed presidential candidates but were actually selecting representatives for their state's Electoral College slate.
A McCain victory quickly became improbable as Obama amassed early wins in his home state of Illinois , the Northeast , and the critical battleground states of Ohio (which no Republican has ever been elected President without winning) and Pennsylvania by 9:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. [215] Obama won the entire Northeast by comfortable margins and the Great Lakes states of Michigan , Wisconsin , and Minnesota by double digits. McCain held on to traditionally Republican states like North Dakota , South Dakota , Nebraska , Kansas , Oklahoma , Montana , Utah , Idaho , Wyoming , and his home state of Arizona . McCain, unlike Bush in 2000 and 2004, failed to win all the southern states: Obama won Florida , North Carolina , and Virginia . Obama also won the hotly contested states of Iowa and New Mexico , which Al Gore had won in 2000 and George W. Bush in 2004. Also, for only the second time since 1940 ( 1964 being the other), Indiana went Democratic, giving Obama all eight Great Lakes states, the first time a presidential candidate had won all of them since Richard Nixon in 1972 .
CNN and Fox News called Virginia for Obama shortly before 11:00 PM, leaving him only 50 electoral votes shy of victory with only six West Coast states ( California , Oregon , Washington , Idaho , Alaska , and Hawaii ) still voting. All American networks called the election in favor of Obama at 11:00 PM as the polls closed on the West Coast. Obama was immediately declared the winner in California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii, McCain won Idaho, and the Electoral College totals were updated to 297 for Obama and 146 for McCain (270 are needed to win). McCain gave a concession speech half an hour later in his hometown of Phoenix, Arizona . [216] Obama appeared just before midnight Eastern Time in Grant Park , Chicago , in front of a crowd of 250,000 people to deliver his victory speech . [217]
Cartogram of the Electoral Votes for 2008 United States presidential election, each square representing one electoral vote. The map shows the impact of winning swing states . Nebraska, being one of two states that are not winner-take-all, for the first time had its votes split, with its second congressional district voting for Obama.
The voter turnout for this election was broadly predicted to be high by American standards, [221] [222] and a record number of votes were cast. [223] The final tally of total votes counted was 131.3 million, compared to 122.3 million in 2004 (which also boasted the highest record since 1968 , the last presidential election before the voting age was lowered to 18). Expressed as a percentage of eligible voters, 131.2 million votes could reflect a turnout as high as 63.0% of eligible voters, which would be the highest since 1960 . [224] [225] This 63.0% turnout rate is based on an estimated eligible voter population of 208,323,000. [225] Another estimate puts the eligible voter population at 213,313,508, resulting in a turnout rate of 61.6%, which would be the highest turnout rate since 1968. [226]
American University 's Center for the Study of the American Electorate released a report on November 6, 2008, two days after the election, which concluded that the anticipated increase in turnout had failed to materialize. [224] That report was the basis for some news articles that indicated voter turnout failed to meet expectations. [227] [228] When the remaining votes were counted after the release of the report, the total number of votes cast in the presidential election was raised to 131.2 million, which surpassed the American University report's preliminary estimate of 126.5 to 128.5 million voters by a factor of between 2% and 4%.
The election saw increased participation from African Americans , who made up 11.1% of the electorate in 2004, versus 13.0% in 2008. [229] According to exit polls, over 95% of African Americans voted for Obama. This played a critical role in southern states such as North Carolina. 74% of North Carolina's registered African American voters turned out, as opposed to 69% of North Carolinians in general, with Obama carrying 100% (with rounding) of African-American females and African Americans age 18 to 29, according to exit polling. [230] This was the case in Virginia as well where much higher turnout among African Americans propelled Obama to victory in the former Republican stronghold. [231] Even in southern states where Obama was unsuccessful, such as Georgia and Mississippi, due to large African American turnout he was much more competitive than John Kerry in 2004. [232] [233]

No other candidate had ballot access in enough states to win 270 electoral votes. All six candidates appeared on the ballot for a majority of the voters, while the 17 other listed candidates were available to no more than 30% of the voters. [235]
The following candidates (and/or parties) had ballot listing and/or write-in status in more than one state: [236]
Alan Keyes ( America's Independent Party ) received 47,746 votes; listed in three states: Colorado and Florida, plus California (listed as American Independent), and also had write-in status in Kentucky, Ohio, Texas, and Utah.
Ron Paul received 42,426 votes; listed in Louisiana (Louisiana Taxpayers) and in Montana (Constitution), with write-in status in California.
Gloria La Riva ( Party for Socialism and Liberation ) received 6,808 votes [237] nationally; listed in 12 states: Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
Brian Moore ( Socialist Party , see Brian Moore presidential campaign, 2008 ) received 6,538 votes; listed in eight states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin, and Tennessee (independent) and Vermont (Liberty Union). He also filed for write-in status in 17 other states: Alaska, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming.
Róger Calero ( Socialist Workers Party ) received 5,151 votes; listed in ten states. He was listed by name in Delaware, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont. James Harris was listed as his stand-in in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, and Washington, and also had write-in status in California.

Tom Stevens ( Objectivist ) received 755 votes; listed in Colorado and Florida.
Gene Amondson ( Prohibition ) received 653 votes; listed in Colorado, Florida, and Louisiana.
Jonathan Allen ( HeartQuake ) received 483 votes; listed only in Colorado, with write-in status in Arizona, Georgia, Montana, Texas, and other states.
The following candidates (parties) were listed on the ballot in only one state:
Richard Duncan (Independent) – Ohio; 3,905 votes.
John Joseph Polachek ( New Party ) Illinois; 1,149 votes.
George Phillies – New Hampshire (also listed with the label Libertarian); 531 votes.
In Nevada, 6,267 votes were cast for "None Of These Candidates". [238] In the three states that officially keep track of "blank" votes for President, 103,193 votes were recorded as "blank". [239] More than 100,000 write-in votes were cast and recorded for a scattering of other candidates, including 62 votes for " Santa Claus " (in ten states) and 11 votes for " Mickey Mouse " (in five states). [240]
According to the Federal Election Commission, an unusually high number of "miscellaneous" write-ins were cast for president in 2008, including 112,597 tallied in the 17 states that record votes for non-listed candidates. [241] There were more presidential candidates on the ballot than at any other time in U. S. history, except for the 1992 election , which also had 23 candidates listed in at least one state.
Popular vote totals are from the official Federal Election Commission report . The results of the electoral vote were certified by Congress on January 8, 2009. [220]

Obama, having a Caucasian mother and Kenyan father of the Luo ethnic group , [248] became the first African American as well as the first bi-racial president. [249] The Obama-Biden ticket was also the first winning ticket in American history on which neither candidate was a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant ; Biden is Roman Catholic and is the first Roman Catholic to be elected Vice President. [250] Obama and Biden were the first President and Vice President elected from the Senate since 1960 ( John F. Kennedy / Lyndon B. Johnson ), Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy, and the Obama-Biden ticket was the first winning Democratic ticket to feature two Northerners since 1940 ( Franklin D. Roosevelt / Henry A. Wallace ). Also, Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976 , the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 , and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944 .
Swing by state. States are listed by (increasing) percentage of Democratic votes, showing how the share of the vote changed between 2004 and 2008. Only five states trended more Republican: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia.
Prior to the election, commentators discussed whether Senator Obama would be able to redraw the electoral map by winning states that had been voting for Republican candidates in recent decades. [251] In many ways, he was successful. He won every region of the country by double digits except the South, which John McCain won by nine percent. Obama won Delaware , the District of Columbia , Maryland , North Carolina , Florida , and Virginia in the South (region as defined by the US Census Bureau ). McCain won most of the Deep South, where white voters have supported Republican candidates by large margins in the last few decades. [252] Obama also defied political bellwethers, becoming the first person to win the presidency while losing Missouri since 1956 (as well as the first Democrat ever to do so) and while losing Kentucky and Tennessee since 1960 . He was the first Democrat to win the presidency without winning West Virginia since 1916 and the first Democrat to win without Arkansas since that state joined the Union in 1836. Indiana and Virginia voted for the Democratic nominee for the first time since 1964 . Although Obama did not win other normally Republican states such as Georgia and Montana (which were won by Bill Clinton in 1992 ), he nonetheless was competitive in both. He lost Montana by just under 3% and Georgia by slightly more than 5%. Also notably, Barack Obama won all of the 2004 swing states (states that either Kerry or Bush won by less than 5%) by a margin of 8.5 percent or more except for Ohio, which the Democrat carried by 4.5 percent.
Obama was the first presidential candidate to split the electoral votes from Nebraska . Together with Maine , which has not yet split its electoral votes, Nebraska is one of two states that split their electoral votes, two going to the statewide popular vote winner and the rest going to the winner of each respective congressional district (Nebraska has three, and Maine has two). Obama won the electoral vote from Nebraska's 2nd congressional district , which contains the city of Omaha . Nebraska's other four electoral votes went to John McCain.
This election exhibited the continuation of some of the polarization trends evident in the 2000 and 2004 elections. [253] McCain won whites 55-43 percent, while Obama won blacks 95-4 percent, [254] Hispanics 67-31 percent, and Asians 62-35 percent. Voters aged 18–29 voted for Obama by 66–32 percent while elderly voters backed McCain 53–45 percent. [255] The 25-year age gap between McCain and Obama was the widest in U.S. presidential election history among the top two candidates. [256]
The 2008 presidential election featured the rise of data journalism in the coverage of politics. Nate Silver , of FiveThiryEight.com, correctly predicted the outcome of 49 of the 50 states and all 35 Senate races. [257]
^ Shirley Chisholm 's prior "win" in New Jersey in 1972 was in a no-delegate-awarding, presidential preference ballot that the major candidates were not listed in and that the only other candidate who was listed had already withdrawn from; the actual delegate selection vote went to George McGovern .

Nobel Prizes in Science
Chemistry: Peter Agre and Roderick MacKinnon (both U.S.) for studies on channels in cell walls.
Physics: Alexei A. Abrikosov (Russia, U.S.), Anthony J. Leggett (UK, U.S.), and Vitaly L. Ginzburg (Russia), for theories about superconductivity.
Physiology or Medicine: Paul C. Lauterbur (U.S.) and Sir Peter Mansfield (UK) for discoveries leading to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).
Scientists uncover the fossil of a new species of flying dinosaur in northeastern China thought to have existed 120 million years ago. It is the first dinosaur ever found with four wings. The Chinese team that found the dinosaur has named it Microraptor gui, after Chinese paleontologist Gu Zhiwei (Jan. 22).
A joint NASA-Princeton University satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), produced a high-resolution map that captured the oldest light in the universe. It provides some of the most important cosmological discoveries in years. The age of the universe has now been accurately determined as 13.7 billion years old and the birth of stars has been pinpointed to just 200 million years after the Big Bang. The WMAP image also revealed the contents of the universe: only 4% is made up of atoms, or the physical universe as we know it. The remainder is made up of poorly understood substances: dark energy (73%) and dark matter (23%). These findings are consistent with the Big Bang and inflation theories, which assert that the universe materialized in a “big bang” and immediately began cooling and expanding (Feb. 11) .
Three fossilized skulls discovered near the Ethiopian village of Herto in 1997 have now been identified as the oldest known remains of modern humans. Assigned to a new human subspecies called Homo sapiens idaltu (idaltu means elder in the Afar language of Ethiopia), the skulls are estimated to be about 160,000 years olda good 50,000 years older than any previously discovered Homo sapiens (announcement made: June 11).
Scientists publish the first comprehensive analysis of the genetic code of the Y chromosome. The Y chromosome provides just 78 genes out of the estimated 30,000 in human DNA and makes few important contributions beyond determining gender (females have two X chromosomes; males have an X and a Y chromosome). Once the size of the X chromosome, which contains about 1,000 genes, the Y chromosome has been rapidly decaying over the course of human evolution, dwindling to a mere tenth of its former self (June 19).
The Hubble telescope has detected the oldest known planetand it appears to have been formed billions of years earlier than astronomers thought possible. Nicknamed Methuselah after the aged biblical patriarch, the planet is an astonishing 12.7 billion years old (July 10).

<h1>Noordin Mohammad Top - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Noordin Mohammad Top (11 </h1>
This is a Malay name ; the name Mohammad Top is a patronymic , not a family name , and the person should be referred to by the given name , Noordin.
Noordin Mohammad Top
Financier, alleged trainer of the splinter group of Jemaah Islamiyah
Criminal penalty
Deceased Autumn 2009
Noordin Mohammad Top (11 August 1968 – 17 September 2009), of Malaysian citizenship, was a Muslim extremist, also referred to as (Noordin) Din Moch Top, Muh Top, or Mat Top, and Indonesia 's most wanted Islamist militant . [1] [2] Born in Kluang , Johor , Malaysia , he is thought to have been a key bomb maker and/or financier for Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and to have left JI and set up a more violent splinter group Tanzim Qaedat al-Jihad . [3] Noordin was reported by the FBI to be "an explosives expert". The FBI also has reported him to be "an officer, recruiter, bomb maker and trainer for the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) group." [4]
Noordin, allegedly nicknamed "Money man", was an indoctrinator who was specialised in recruiting militants into becoming suicide bombers and collecting funds for militant activities. [7]
Having long since been wanted by Malaysian and Indonesian authorities he was added to the FBI's third major "wanted" list in 2006. FBI Seeking Information - War on Terrorism list . [8]
He was killed during a police raid in Solo, Central Java , on the 17th of September 2009 conducted by the Indonesian anti-terrorist team, Densus 88 . [9]
Contents
It is thought that Noordin may have assisted in planning the 2002 Bali Bombings , in which 202 people were killed. [6]
On the 5th of August 2003 a suicide bomber detonated a car bomb outside the lobby of the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, killing 12 people and injuring 150. Jemaah Islamiyah was suspected of responsibility for the bombing. [10]
In July 2004 a car bomb was exploded outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta, killing several people including the suicide bomber and wounding over 140 others. [11] Jemaah Islamiyah with Azahari Husin and Noordin M. Top were suspected of being behind the bombing. [12]
On the 1st of October 2005 bombs were detonated in Jimbaran and Kuta in Bali. The bombings killed 23 people, including three bombers trained by Noordin. [9] [13]
In July 2009, two suicide bombers killed seven people at the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott hotels in Jakarta. Local anti-terrorism officials said that there were "strong indications" that Noordin Top was behind the attacks. [4]
On 21 July 2005, Irun Hidayat was convicted of being an accessory by providing a house to Azahari Husin and Noordin Top.
After the October 2005 attack, a Philippine security official said that for months intelligence officials in Southeast Asia had received information that the al-Qaeda -linked Jemaah Islamiyah group was orchestrating a major strike, possibly in the Philippines or Indonesia, but were unable to uncover the plot's details in time to prevent it. [14]
Mbai identified the chief suspect in the 2005 attack as Azahari Husin, who was thought to collaborate with the second suspect Noordin, whose wife was sentenced to three years in prison for harbouring him. [15] Azahari Husin was later killed in a raid in November 2005.
On the 24th of February 2006 the FBI added Noordin among three names to the Seeking Information – War on Terrorism list. [16]
On the 29th of April 2006 he narrowly escaped capture after his safe-house was raided by heavily armed Indonesian police in Binangun , Central Java . In the altercation, Abdul Hadi and Jabir were killed. [17]
In June 2006 it was reported that Noordin was threatening more attacks in video tapes recovered by Indonesian authorities and police believe that he may have formed his own organisation outside JI. [18]
On the 8th of August 2009 there were media reports that he had been killed during a shooting with police near Temanggung , a village in Central Java . Forensic testing conducted by Indonesian police however, disproved this speculation. A body recovered from the ambush site was instead found to be Ibrohim, a key organiser of the 2009 Jakarta bombings . [19]
Indonesian National Police Chief Bambang Hendarso Danuri announced on the 17th of September 2009 that Noordin was killed in a police raid along with three other terrorists. Police hunting for suspects in bombings of July 2009 tracked the seven suspects to Solo in Central Java and besieged a village house on the outskirts overnight. The raid ended near daybreak when an explosion was detonated inside the home. Four suspected militants were killed and three were captured. The operation left behind a charred house with no roof and blown-out walls. The bodies were flown to Jakarta for autopsies. [20]
Among the four bodies recovered after the raid a corpse was identified as Noordin's; [21] fingerprints taken from the Indonesian corpse matched samples obtained from Malaysia. A similarity was found in at least 14 minutiae points. [22] On 19 September 2009, Indonesian National Police spokesperson announced that a DNA test was also carried out and it was proved that the body is Noordin's. [23] According to a police intelligence officer, the renter of the house, "Susilo", Noordin's close associate Bagus Budi Pranoto, alias "Urwah" and Aryo Sudarso, alias Mistam Hisamuddin, were killed in the raid, along with Noordin. [24] Police were led to the house after arresting Indonesian militant Rohmat Puji Prabowo at a marketplace in Solo on 16 September. [25]
Sidney Jones, the South east Asia programme director of the International Crisis Group commented that Noordin's death was "a huge blow for the extremist organizations in Indonesia and the region", because "there isn't another radical leader in Indonesia who has given that same message so consistently." [1]
During his exiles and escapes from police raids, Noordin married several women in Indonesia and produced several children from those marriages.
He married Munfiatun AKA Fitri on the 7th of July 2004. Fitri was sentenced to three years in prison for protecting him. He also married an unidentified woman in Rokan Hilir , Riau , during his exile after the first Bali Bombing . Around 2007, he also married Ariani Rahma during his exile in Cilacap . One other unidentified woman was also believed to be Noordin's wife during his time in police custody. These marriages were believed to be a part of his strategy to socialize with the local people in order to keep his identity secret. His first wife was an Indonesian-born Malaysian woman, who now lives in Johor , Malaysia , with their son. [26] [27]

Terrorism Mastermind Noordin Top Killed

Police hunting Noordin, one of Asia's top terror suspects, surrounded a house in central Java, Indonesia and were exchanging gunfire with suspected militants holed up inside it Friday Aug 7 2009, police and a witness said.

Police hunting for suspects in Jakarta hotel bombings raided a hide-out in central Indonesia, sparking gunfire and an explosion Thursday that left four suspected militants dead, including Noordin, national police Chief Bambang Hendarso Danuri said. Three alleged terrorists also were captured.
Noordin's remains were found in the house on the outskirts of the town of Solo in central Java after the hours-long gunfight, he said.
Fingerprints of Noordin's stored on a police database matched those of the body, Danuri said. DNA tests have not yet been conducted.
"It is Noordin M. Top," he told a nationally televised news conference to loud cheers from the audience. Documents and laptop computers confiscated from the house prove that Noordin "is the leader of al Qaeda in Southeast Asia," he said.
Hundreds of pounds (kilograms) of explosives, M-16 assault rifles, grenades and bombs were removed from the house as ambulances shuttled away the dead and injured.
"We asked Noordin M. Top to surrender, but they kept firing," Danuri said. "That is how he died ... he even had bullets in his pockets."
Noordin, a Malaysian citizen, fled to Indonesia in 2002 amid a crackdown on Muslim extremists in Malaysia in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States. He was linked to bombings on the Indonesian resort island of Bali in 2002 and 2005 that together killed 222 people, mostly foreigners.
"The most dangerous terrorist in Southeast Asia has been put out of commission," said Jim Della-Giacoma, Southeast Asia project director for the International Crisis Group think tank.
"It would have been better if police had managed to arrest him alive, but it appears that this was not an option," he said. "Unfortunately, Noordin's death does not mean an end to terrorism in Indonesia, though it has been dealt a significant blow."
Noordin, who is accused of heading a splinter group of the al Qaeda-funded regional terror group Jemaah Islamiyah, has been implicated in every major attack in Indonesia since 2003, including a pair of suicide bombings at Jakarta's J.W. Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in July that killed seven people and wounded more than 50.
He is also blamed for an earlier attack on the J.W. Marriott in 2003 and a bombing at the Australian Embassy in 2004.
A counterterrorism official said the militants killed Thursday included alleged bomb-maker Bagus Budi Pranato. The captured militants included a pregnant woman who is being treated at a hospital, national police spokesman Nanan Sukarna said. She was in stable condition.
Police tracked the seven suspects to the town of Solo and besieged a village house on its outskirts overnight. The raid ended near daybreak when an explosion occurred inside the home, Sukarna said.
The operation left behind a charred house with no roof and blown-out walls. The bodies were flown to Jakarta for autopsies.

Noordin Mohammed Top is one of Asia most wanted criminals.
He is known as the 'Money Man' for his suspected role in financing the 2002 Bali bombings which killed 202 people, including 88 Australians.
The FBI lists him as armed and dangerous, and he is thought to have masterminded the July bombing of two luxury hotels in Jakarta which killed nine people including two suicide bombers. Three Australians were among the dead.
An August 2009 raid on his alleged hideout led to a flurry of speculation as DNA results were awaited to confirm whether or not he had been killed.
An expert told the Jakarta Post that the central Java hamlet targeted by police was unlikely to have been Top's hiding place as it was surrounded by hills.
According to the expert, Top has favoured open areas that allow an easy escape during almost a decade on the run.
Top is believed to be responsible for a 2003 attack on Jakarta's JW Marriott hotel which killed 12 people, and another on the Australian embassy in 2004 which killed 11 people.
Also known as Noordin Muh Top, Noordin Mat Top and Noordin Din Moch Top, he was born on August 11 1968, in Johor, Malaysia.
He fled his native country following the 2001 September 11 attacks, as the government cracked down on Islamists, and married in Indonesia under the name Abdurrachman Aufi.
Four years later, his wife Munfiatun was jailed for hiding his whereabouts.
Security organisations including the FBI list Noordin as a senior operative for regional militant group, Jemaah Islamiah, as well as an explosives expert, recruiter and trainer.
However, according to recent reports he has broken away from the fundamentalist organisation thought to be supported al-Qaeda and started his own splinter group.
Noordin's closest ally, Malaysian bomb-maker Azahari Husin, was killed in 2005. The same year, Noordin Top produced a video threatening further attacks on Australians.
“We repeat that America, Australia, England and Italy are all our enemies. We especially remind Australia that you, Downer and Howard, are killing Australia, leading it into darkness and misfortune and mujahedin terror,” Noordin said on the tape.
“Know that as long as you all continue to colonise the land of Iraq and Afghanistan and intimidate Muslims, then you too will feel our intimidation and terror.”

Suspected bomb-maker Noordin Top has been killed in a police raid on a militant hideout in Central Java, Indonesian police say.
Noordin's body was among four recovered after the early morning raid on a village house in Central Java, national police chief Bambang Hendarso Danuri told reporters, bringing to an end an exhaustive six-year manhunt.
"From national police doctors' examinations, antemortem (investigations) and finger prints sent by Malaysian police, thank God on this holy month of Ramadan... it's Noordin M Top," Danuri said to applause.
Loud explosions and gunfire were heard as police raided the rented house at around sunrise after a nine-hour siege on the outskirts of Solo city, a stronghold of the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) radical network.
The raid left the simple house in the lush, densely populated region a burnt-out shell.
Danuri said police from an elite unit known as Special Detachment 88 launched the raid after interrogating two Noordin acolytes arrested nearby on Wednesday afternoon.
"Despite repeated warnings to surrender there was a firefight. A motorcycle was hit, caught fire and they took refuge by huddling in the bathroom," Danuri said.
"But our men breached the wall as morning prayers came, at around 5:00 or 6:00 am we carried out a quick operation in three hours and we managed to disable them."
Danuri said those killed along with Noordin were "expert bomb-maker" Bagus Budi Pranoto, alias Urwah, close Noordin associate Ario Sudarso, alias Aji, and the renter of the house, Susilo.
He said two men were also arrested and Susilo's wife, who was wounded in the raid, was also in custody.
Police found 200 kilograms (440 pounds) of explosive powder already "prepared" by the militants as well as loaded M-16 assault rifles, laptops and surveillance equipment inside the house, he said.
Noordin, a 41-year-old Malaysian who was Southeast Asia's most-wanted man, led a radical splinter faction of the Jemaah Islamiyah terror network blamed for a string of deadly attacks.
The offshoot, labelled Al-Qaeda in the Malay Archipelago, is suspected of being behind the July 17 suicide attacks on Jakarta's JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels.
The bombings, which killed seven people including six foreigners, were the first major attacks in Indonesia in nearly four years.
"It's a major blow for terrorism in Indonesia generally. I think Noordin was the person most single-mindedly devoted to pursuing the Al-Qaeda line in Indonesia," International Crisis Group analyst Sidney Jones said.
"I don't think we can conclude that the problem is over and done with because there are a number of fugitives who are still at large, and some of whom could fill Noordin's shoes."
"Unquestionably, Noodin's network will be severely weakened but it may not disappear."
Police believe they narrowly missed Noordin in a dramatic televised raid in August on a safe house in Temanggung, also Central Java.
Noordin was initially reported dead at the end of the 17-hour siege but the body later turned out to be that of a florist working in the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotel complex who helped plot the attacks from the inside.
Noordin allegedly also masterminded a 2003 attack on the Marriott that killed 12 people, as well as the Australian embassy bombing and 2005 attacks on tourist restaurants on the holiday island of Bali.
Jemaah Islamiyah's ultimate goal is to unite Indonesia, Brunei, Malaysia, Singapore and the southern Philippines into a fundamentalist Islamic state.
Noordin's faction is estranged from JI's mainstream, which has rejected spectacular attacks. But analysts say he was able to fall back on a network of sympathetic schools and families while continuing to recruit.

Indonesian commandos kill terrorist leader
Noordin Top, a master bomber, headed Southeast Asia's version of Al Qaeda.

JAKARTA — Ending a six-year national dragnet, Indonesia’s elite counterterrorism force killed the self-proclaimed leader of Southeast Asia’s version of Al Qaeda Thursday in a dramatic six-hour firefight in the central Javanese city of Solo.
Malaysian-born Noordin Mohammed Top has been behind every terrorist bombing in Indonesia since 2003: the first Jakarta Marriot hotel bombing that year, the 2004 Australian Embassy bombing, the 2005 Bali bombings and July’s coordinated attacks on the Marriot and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta that killed seven people, six of them foreigners. More than 50 people were also injured in that attack.
“In this holy month of Ramadan the country of Indonesia has been blessed,” Bambang Hendarso Danuri, Indonesia’s chief of police, said at a press conference. “This is a gift.”
It also removes a big security threat to U.S. President Barack Obama, who's planning to visit his former childhood home later this year.
The police acted on a tip given to them by two suspects arrested just hours before the raid began. The suspects said they believed several militants were hiding out in a small house in Solo, a city known as a bastion of radical activity. Police did not know Noordin was inside at the time.
At about midnight Thursday, police evacuated villagers surrounding the house and through a loudspeaker asked the militants to come outside with their hands in the air. The militants began firing, sparking a six-hour shootout. At about 4 a.m., an explosion went off inside the house, leading to speculation that the militants had detonated a suicide bomb to avoid arrest.
Rumors had long swirled that Noordin had explosives strapped to his body at all times. Police, however, said the militants were killed by gunfire.
After Noordin’s body was brought to a Jakarta hospital, it was so badly mutilated that it took forensic experts hours to identify him.
Inside the house, which had been blasted apart, police said they found 200 kilograms of explosives, an M-16 machine gun with bullets, a laptop and documents. The documents, they said, pointed to several connections between the militants and Al Qaeda, but they did not elaborate.
The commandos also killed Bagus Budi Pranato in the raid. Known as Urwah, he is a reputed bombmaker thought to be involved in July’s bombings. Urwah is known to be one of Noordin’s closest associates and helped Noordin coordinate the Australian Embassy bombing before his arrest several months before. He was released in April 2007, only three and a half years later.
Sidney Jones, an analyst with the International Crisis Group in Jakarta, said Urwah was able to re-establish contact with Noordin almost immediately after his release, revealing how well-connected Indonesia’s militants are.
The two others killed were Adib Susilo, who rented the house, and Aji, who police said was a protege of the Malaysian Azahari Husin, a master bombmaker who came to Indonesia alongside Noordin but was killed by Indonesian police during a 2005 raid on his house.
Noordin had reached almost legendary status in militant circles for his almost magical ability to evade capture. In the last six years he has been minutes away from being caught on half a dozen occasions. He was nearly caught last month when police raided a farmhouse in central Java. The ensuing 16-hour shootout, however, turned up only one body.

<h1>List of ships attacked by Somali pirates in 2009 </h1>
From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
Contents
2009-01-01
Capture failed
About 50 miles off the coast of Yemen , the cargo ship S Venus was moving through the Gulf of Aden when a small boat with several pirates started to pursue it. The ship sent a distress call to a nearby French Frigate , the Premier-Maître L'Her [2] that was part of an international task group sent to Somalia to help stop and deter piracy. The approaching frigate scared off the pirates, but several hours later they tried again to approach the ship. That time, the French frigate captured and boarded the boat. French forces then arrested eight men. They also found a rocket launcher, assault rifles and several boarding ladders on the pirates' vessel. According to a French spokesperson, the eight men captured would be taken to Somalia for their trial. [3]
2009-01-01
Somali pirates hijacked the Egyptian cargo ship Blue Star and its 28 crewmembers right after the ship exited the Red Sea and went into the Gulf of Aden. According to the Associated Press , there were fifteen armed pirates on board and the cargo is 6,000 tons of fertilizer. [4] According to Egyptian Deputy Foreign minister, Ahmed Rizq, company contacts were trying to negotiate a ransom. [5] The ship was released with all of its crew on March 5 after a one million dollar ransom was rumored to have been paid. [6] Afterwards the ship was en route to Kenya for refueling and then return to the Egyptian port of Alexandria . [7]

Capture failed
An Indian tanker, the MT Abul Kalam Azad, managed to repel two pirate skiffs with the help of the 2 helicopters dispatched from the Malaysian warship Sri Indera Sakti and an unnamed Saudi Arabian warship. It was then given a frigate escort. [8]
2009-01-02
Capture failed
The captain of the Kriti Episkopi saw the pirates and took evasive action. When this did not work, he hailed a nearby EU ship. Pirates in 3 speedboats approached the Kriti Episkopi twice with machine guns and RPG's and tried to board. However, the pirates were driven away the crew, who aimed high pressure fire hoses and sprayed them. While the crew was fighting off the pirates, EU aircraft took off from the nearby Taskforce 150 and arrived to help. The air support remained by the cargo ship and scared off the pirates while a frigate came to escort the ship. [9]

An oil tanker, registered in Panama, was hijacked on the 2 or 3 of January. The ship had a crew of 8 Indian sailors. [10] On the 26 of April 2009, Ecoterra International announced that the ship had been released. [11]

The Dutch Antilles-flagged ship Samanyolu was attacked by pirates but fired a flare at them, setting the pirate boat on fire. The Danish HDMS Absalon intervened and arrested 5 pirates. They were to be tried in Rotterdam. [12] [13] [14]
unknown
A small fishing vessel was attacked off the Somali coast, with a crew of 4 Kenyans and 3 Indian sailors. [10] The pirates attacked the vessel which was anchored at the Kenyan harbor of Kiunga , 18km from the Somali border. Three people of Somali origin came in a fast skiff during the night and boarded the ship, kidnapping the three Indian crew members and mysteriously leaving the Kenyan crew unharmed. [15] The pirates also left the ship unharmed and did not remove it from its anchorage. The ship belongs to a Kenyan company known as the Southern Engineering Company, which is part of the Alpha Group, known to be fishing illegally in Somali waters. It is possible that the kidnapping was a revenge attack targeting the company and its fishermen, also possibly involving the Kenyan sailors who may have been working with the kidnappers.

An Iranian factory fishing ship was captured by pirates off the coast of Puntland in an apparent vigilante action.

During the last phase of the operation, the U.S. president's security advisor James Jones withheld final approval for the operation out of concern for the safety of the 25 sailors aboard the vessel. This led the German department of defense to abort the planned attack on the freighter for now and the GSG-9 unit returned to their base of operations at the airport of Mombassa , Kenya . spiegel.de
Among the captured sailors held hostage were eleven Tuvaluans and one Fijian . A ransom of US$15 million was demanded.

[41] A second attempt took place later that week, when two pirate boats approached the ship and opened fire, but were driven off when Israeli security guards on board returned fire. [42]

Somali pirates captured the Ariana on May 2 with its 24 Ukrainian crew in the Indian Ocean en route from Brazil to the Middle East. [78] In November, with the release of Spanish ship Alakrana, that was in contact during captivity with the Ariana to give fuel, was known that within this vessel are kidnapped two women and a girl of 12 years old. One of the abducted women, Larisa Salinska, 39 years old ship's cook, was raped by pirates. Then she had a miscarriage (it is unknown if she became pregnant as a result of the rape or not) with a large hemorrhage, heavy infection, and serious health problems. The Alakrana’s skipper tried to convey to the Ariana medicines to help Salinska, but Adan Jama, one of the pirates who had hijacked the Spanish ship, threw overboard those medicines. [79] Also, according to the testimony from the driver's Alakrana, on board were two women, one of whom had given birth during the hijacking of the ship, having the baby about four months; also said the girl who was twelve years old was raped by a pirate. [80] The ship was released on 10 December 2009 after a ransom of almost $ 3,000,000 was paid. [81]

On 17 May, the Royal Australian Navy frigates HMAS Sydney and HMAS Ballarat responded to a distress call from the MV Dubai Princess, who reported that they were under attack from RPG -armed pirates attempting to board their vessel. Another vessel, MV MSC Stella, was also being harassed. The pirates fled the area after the two frigates and a Sea Hawk helicopter from Sydney appeared. The action occurred in international waters about 170 kilometres (92 nmi) south of Yemen. Sydney and Ballarat were on a six month international deployment and were passing through the Gulf of Aden at the time of the incident. [85] [86] [87] [88]

On 8 July, the Turkish-owned cargo ship MV Horizon-1 carrying dry sulfur from Saudi Arabia to Jordan was hijacked at 08:29 EEST (05:29 UTC ) by five armed Somali pirates in the Gulf of Aden . The ship was brought first to the Somali port Hordio along with her 23-member crew including a female third officer . [92] [93] On July 10, the Horizon-1 left Hordio and sailed to the so-called pirate haven of Eyl in 60 nmi (110 km; 69 mi) distance southwards, cruising at low speed for unknown reason. [94] The vessel was harassed on March 19 as she was on its way from Ukraine to China witnessing the hijacking of the Greek vessel MV Titan. The attack had failed due to appearance of naval forces at the site. [95] [96] On October 5, 2009, the vessel was released with its crew against a ransom of US$ 2,750,000 paid by a British mediator.

Pirates attacked the vessel near Mogadishu harbor. During the hijacking attempt, the Syrian captain was killed and several crewmen wounded. Somali police and African Union peacekeepers rescued the ship. [98]

At the moment of the attack, the vessel was out of the area protected by Operation Atalanta . Two pirates were seized and brought to Spain. Pirates demanded both a four million Euro ransom and for the two pirates to be released. On November 7th thousands gathered in Bermeo (from where most of the crew came) asking for the release of the pirates. The crew was freed without the pirates being released. The two pirates where judged in Spain in a very controversial process as it was difficult to ascertain whether one of the pirates was a minor or not. The incident made the Spanish Government change its law to allow security guards to carry guns up to 12,70mm in vessels with Spanish flag. Spanish journals published pirates' families were given $50.000. [99] [100] [101] [102]

On October 7, 2009, the Somme , an 18,000-tonne Durance-class command vessel, fuel tanker, and flagship of the French Navy , was mistaken for a cargo vessel and attacked at night in the Indian Ocean by lightly armed Somali Pirates from two armed skiffs. The pirates opened fire on the ship with small arms and launchers. The ship returned fire and headed towards the pirates. The pirates attempted to flee after realizing that the ship was a military vessel. The Somme intercepted one of the boats and gave chase. After an hour long chase, the pirates surrendered and were detained aboard the ship. Other warships arrived and began searching for the escaped skiff. The Somme had been operating 310 miles off the coast of Somalia, on its way to refuel frigates patrolling shipping lanes. [103]
$4 million
Captured 300 nautical miles (560 km) north of the Seychelles . Heading to Mombasa, Kenya . [104] The ship was released on 28 December, with China claiming to have rescued the crew. A Canadian warship provided logistical and medical assistance to the ship. [105]
$4 million
On October 19, 2009, the Chinese bulk carrier, owned by COSCO Qingdaq, was captured 700 miles east of the Somali coastline in the Indian Ocean. Two skiffs were utilized in the capture. This was the farthest afield that the Somali pirates had ever struck, and the attack occurred with three Chinese naval vessels in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean. [106] [107] [108]
$3.1 million
On October 22, 2009, this ship was hijacked as it traveled from Novorossiysk, Russia to Mombasa, Kenya . It was captured about 330km off the Seychelles . At least six pirates and two skiffs were involved in the apprehension. [109] [110] [111]

The yacht Lynn Rival was on a voyage from the Seychelles to Tanzania when she was attacked by Somali pirates. A distress call was sent. [112] The yacht was found on 29 October following a multi-agency search but the two crew, Paul and Rachel Chandler , were not on board. It was later revealed that they were being held on board the container ship MV Kota Wajah moored off Ceel Huur , Somalia. [113] It was later reported that Royal Navy personnel on board RFA Wave Knight witnessed the transfer of the two crew from the Lynn Rival, [114] but did not intervene for fear of causing casualties among the kidnapped couple. A ransom of US$7,000,000 ( £ 4,300,000) had been demanded. The couple were reported to have been transferred from Koto Wajah to another vessel and then to shore. [115] The Foreign Office had stated that no ransom would be paid and the Somali community in the United Kingdom appealed for the crew to be released on humanitarian grounds, citing the fact that the yacht was not involved in the dumping of toxic waste or illegal fishing and was in international waters. [114] Lynn Rival was returned to the United Kingdom on RFA Wave Knight , arriving at Portland, Dorset on 26 November 2009. [116] The Chandlers were released over a year later on 14 November 2010 after a ransom of US$750,000 was paid. [117]

1995
The 2010 Moscow Metro bombings were suicide bombings carried out by two women during the morning rush hour of March 29, 2010, at two stations of the Moscow Metro ( Lubyanka and Park Kultury ), with roughly 40 minutes interval between. At least 40 people were killed, and over 100 injured.
Russian officials called the incident "the deadliest and most sophisticated terrorist attack in the Russian capital in six years", [5] a reference to the Avtozavodskaya and Rizhskaya bombings in 2004. At the time of the attacks, an estimated 500,000 people were commuting through Moscow's metro system. [6]
Initial investigation indicated that the bombings were perpetrated by the Islamist [7] [8] Chechen terrorists of the Caucasus Emirate. [8] [9] On March 31, Chechen terrorist leader Doku Umarov confirmed suspicions when he claimed responsibility for ordering the attacks in a video released on the internet. He has also stated that such attacks in Russia will continue unless Russia grants independence to Muslim states in the North Caucasus region. [10] The man who brought the suicide bombers to Moscow was arrested in July 2010. [11] The Anti-Terror Committee of Russia confirmed in August 2010 that Magomedali Vagabov , along with four other militants, was killed in an operation in Dagestan. He is believed to be a militant behind the bombings, a close associate of Doku Umarov and the husband of Mariam Sharipova, one of the two suicide bombers. [12]
Contents
The bombings were the latest in a series of attacks in Russia since 1994, many attributed to Chechen terrorists or to the " Caucasus Emirate ". [13] Since 1999, Chechen separatists gradually shifted away from a pro-western terroristic approach of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria , strongly influenced by Wahhabi beliefs which placed them at odds not only with Russia and Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov , but also with a Dagestani population with strong Sufi traditions. [14] [15] A mujahideen group [7] [8] [14] [16] claim they are fighting a " holy war ", [17] and wish to create an "Emirate" in the Caucasus. [18] Over 5,000 people have been killed and wounded in the Caucasus since 2002. [19]
About 48 hours after the Moscow Metro bombings a double suicide bombing hit the Caucasian Republic of Dagestan , killing the city police chief amongst others. Russia immediately drew parallels, saying the two bombings were linked. [20] On April 1 another bombing in Dagestan killed two more people. [21] On April 5, exactly a week after the Moscow attacks, another bombing in Ingushetia targeting a police barracks drew parallels between that and the Dagestan attacks. It was seen as a fear that these incidents lead to an escalation of violence as a whole. [22]
Locations of the attacks on a metro map
The first explosion occurred on the Red Arrow – 75 years train at the Lubyanka station at approximately 7:56 am local time (3:56 am UTC ). The train started from Yugo-Zapadnaya , and stopped at Lubyanka station. Once the train doors opened, explosives worn by a woman standing at the second carriage's second exit detonated. The explosive had a force of up to 1.5 kg of trinitrotoluene (TNT). [23] Fifteen people on board the train, and eleven people on the platform were killed. One victim from the third carriage died from a head injury caused by an 8 mm (0.31 in) piece of metal. [24]
A second explosion at the Park Kultury station followed at approximately 8:38 am, caused by another female, who at the time of the first explosion was riding another train from Sokolniki station in the same direction. At the time of first explosion, the second train had stopped between Frunzenskaya and Park Kultury stations. It was announced over the speakers that due to technical problems, the train would have to unload the passengers at the next stop. About 40 minutes later, the train reached the station, and once its doors opened, the second female suspect detonated the second explosion, killing fourteen commuters. [24] Panic included stampedes at both stations, as commuters attempted to escape. [9] The second attack was carried out by a dark-haired woman with the equivalent of 2 kg of TNT strapped to her waist. Both bombs were packed with metal nuts, bolts and screws, to increase the destructive impact of the blasts. [25] [26]
The Red Arrow – 75 years train

The two women who carried out the attacks wore explosive belts, presumably using detonation devices set inside their mobile phones and activated by a call to self. [27] The attackers intended to strike during peak hours on a weekday when the subway would be at capacity. Eyewitnesses said that some survivors were so badly injured that they constantly splashed heavy amounts of blood on the floor and walls, until they were attended to by doctors. [28]
Alexander Bortnikov , the FSB chief, said its investigation pointed to "terrorist groups related to the North Caucasus ". [29]

At least 39 people, aged between 16 and 65, were killed in the explosions. [31] A 40th victim died of her injuries on March 30. [32] [33] This figure was revised upwards from an earlier count of 36 killed, that had consisted of 24 people in the explosion at the Lubyanka station and 12 at Park Kultury. Two other people died in the resulting stampede at both the stations after the blast. Three of the dead were minors. [34]
A high-ranking official of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, Captain Viktor Ginkut, was also amongst the passengers killed at Park Kultury station. [35] His residential registry in Sevastopol , Ukraine has raised the question of his actual nationality, but Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia refused to comment on it. [36]
Over 100 other passengers sustained mild to serious injuries. [9] [27] Five of the injured passengers remained in critical condition for an extended period.
Subsequent false alarms[ edit ]
A third reportedly failed detonation was announced by Life News roughly 40 minutes later, aimed at one of the two Prospekt Mira stations; however, no explosives were found in the plastic bag, after it was taken from the station. [37] Around 10:04 am local time a call from a public phone announcing another planned explosion was made to the Begovaya station staff, but the caller soon revealed it to be a hoax. [38]
Another hoax occurred about an hour after the second explosion at the Ulitsa Podbelskogo station when passengers noticed a Muslim woman entering the train. [39] [40]
Overcrowded surface public transport lines on the day of the bombings
Russian television carried little coverage of the attacks for the first hour after the first explosion took place (at 7:57 am). Commentators have criticised this, alleging that it spread more panic and led to citizens feeling helpless. [41] [42]
Around 11:00 am local time, a special operation was launched to patrol all the subway stations in search of possible clues to trace the instigators. Squads of local police performed passport control at every station of the Sokolnicheskaya Line . [43]
Commuters leave flowers at the Lubyanka station
Russia's Interior Ministry head Rashid Nurgaliyev said security was being boosted across the country, "in particular in those cities with metro systems." [44] March 30 was declared a nationwide Day of Mourning. [45] Prime Minister Vladimir Putin issued a decree ordering the allocation from the Reserve Fund of 300,000 rubles (approx. $11,000 USD) to the families of those killed in the bombings, plus 18,000 rubles for funeral expenses, and of 50,000–100,000 rubles to those who were injured in the attacks, depending on the severity of their injuries. [46] [47]
Authorities have announced that due to upcoming Easter (Paskha), May 1 International Workers Day and May 9 Victory Day , strict security would be imposed on Moscow's metro network up until May 15, 2010. [48] As a result of the terror bombings, the number of daily commuters in the Moscow metro decreased by 17% the next day. [49]
the Moscow metro bombings
According to Interfax news agency, citing law enforcement sources, surveillance cameras captured two women – aged between 18 and 20 – boarding the metro at the Yugo-Zapadnaya station. Police were hunting for one 30-year-old man with North Caucasian features, and two other women of Slavic appearance aged 22 and 45 who had been seen shepherding the bombers into the station.

Unconfirmed reports said the perpetrators tried to take the explosives to the Russian Ministry of Defense building on Arbat street . [45] Law enforcement also speculated the suicide bombers may have confused the stations, missing one of their original targets – Oktyabrskaya station. They opine that the attackers intended to blow up the Lubyanka station, which is located next to central headquarters of FSB , and then Oktyabrskaya, which is attached to the Ministry of Internal Affairs . [51] Officials suspect that Muslim rebels from the troubled North Caucasus region that includes Chechnya are responsible for the attack. [9] [37] [52] The link to the Caucasian group [53] [54] was immediate. According to preliminary reports, law enforcement were notified about possible terror acts through three telegrams indicating potential threats to Moscow's transport system, but the suicide bombers passed through the security. Unofficial reports the morning before the attacks took place indicate many female passengers of North Caucasian appearance were stopped and checked by Moscow security enforcement under pretence of routine ID verifications, and taken to local precincts. [24]
Commuters leave flowers at the Park Kultury station
The Investigation Committee of the Procuracy of the Russian Federation started a criminal investigation under Article 205 of the Russian Criminal Code ("act of terrorism"). [55]
Two female natives of Daghestan are believed to have detonated the explosions. Russian authorities released photographs of both women, showing their facial features to be intact and possibly identifiable. [56] [57] Russia's FSB security service have named the suicide bomber behind the Park Kultury metro station explosion [58] as Dzhanet Abdullayeva (1992-2010), "black widow" who had lived in the Khasavyurtsky region of Dagestan. [56] She was the widow of 30-year-old Umalat Magomedov, a prominent insurgent killed by Russian forces on December 31, 2009. [59] Investigators confirmed that the second attacker was Maryam Sharipova, a 28-year-old schoolteacher from Dagestan, after her father identified her body [60] although he claimed she had a degree in mathematics and psychology and taught computer science while never expressing any "radical beliefs." Although there was some speculation as to whether her brother had been arrested in connection to North Caucassian fighters. [3] [61] Police had identified an apartment rented out by two suspected accomplices of the bombers. The men were believed to have accompanied the women to a metro station in the southwest of the city and handed over the bomb belts. They then went back to the apartment where they were said to have remotely detonated the charges. The two were known to police who have put them on a wanted list. [58]
Moscow said that there were an additional twenty-one "black widows" ready to strike, and were studying if the alleged attackers were part of an original group of thirty. [62] Female suicide bombers , known as "black widows," have been involved in suicide bombings on numerous occasions, including 2004 bombings of two passenger planes that took off from Domodedovo International Airport , previous Moscow metro bombings, the Moscow theater hostage crisis , and the Beslan school hostage crisis . [56]
The Caucasus Emirate immediately denied responsibility for the attack, saying that they planned attacks on economic targets inside Russia, but not against civilians. However, the attack followed a warning from Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov the prior month of his intent to spread the Caucasian insurgency to Russian cities. [62]

On May 13, FSB director Aleksandr Bortnikov announced that they had identified all members of the group behind the attack and that three of the members were killed during a raid in an attempt to detain them, one of them being the person who escorted the suicide bombers from Dagestan to Moscow. [65] Bortnikov was quoted as saying: "To our great regret, we were unable to detain them alive because they put up fierce armed resistance and were killed." [66]
Following the attacks, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as well as Ramzan Kadyrov , President of the Chechen Republic , were quick to comment on the attacks. The heads of Russia's three biggest religious bodies also condemned the attacks and called for justice. The Russian Council of Muftis said that "extremism and terrorism have no basis in the Holy Qur'an ," and added that "a terrorist cannot be a Muslim while a Muslim cannot be a terrorist." [67] Russia's chief rabbi , Berel Lazar , said he was sure the masterminds of the terrorist attack would get the punishment they deserved. [67]
The attack also sparked condemnation and expressions of condolence from numerous governments and heads of state, as well as international bodies such as NATO , the Council of Europe , and the European Union who also condemned the attacks and/or expressed condolences to the victims' families. [68] [69]
Amongst media reactions, there was controversy about how the Russian media handled the reporting in the first hours after the attack. Outside Russia, the United States increased security and police presence on transit systems in New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Atlanta following the attacks. [70]

1995
The 2010 Moscow Metro bombings were suicide bombings carried out by two women during the morning rush hour of March 29, 2010, at two stations of the Moscow Metro ( Lubyanka and Park Kultury ), with roughly 40 minutes interval between. At least 40 people were killed, and over 100 injured.
Russian officials called the incident "the deadliest and most sophisticated terrorist attack in the Russian capital in six years", [5] a reference to the Avtozavodskaya and Rizhskaya bombings in 2004. At the time of the attacks, an estimated 500,000 people were commuting through Moscow's metro system. [6]
Initial investigation indicated that the bombings were perpetrated by the Islamist [7] [8] Chechen terrorists of the Caucasus Emirate. [8] [9] On March 31, Chechen terrorist leader Doku Umarov confirmed suspicions when he claimed responsibility for ordering the attacks in a video released on the internet. He has also stated that such attacks in Russia will continue unless Russia grants independence to Muslim states in the North Caucasus region. [10] The man who brought the suicide bombers to Moscow was arrested in July 2010. [11] The Anti-Terror Committee of Russia confirmed in August 2010 that Magomedali Vagabov , along with four other militants, was killed in an operation in Dagestan. He is believed to be a militant behind the bombings, a close associate of Doku Umarov and the husband of Mariam Sharipova, one of the two suicide bombers. [12]

The bombings were the latest in a series of attacks in Russia since 1994, many attributed to Chechen terrorists or to the " Caucasus Emirate ". [13] Since 1999, Chechen separatists gradually shifted away from a pro-western terroristic approach of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria , strongly influenced by Wahhabi beliefs which placed them at odds not only with Russia and Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov , but also with a Dagestani population with strong Sufi traditions. [14] [15] A mujahideen group [7] [8] [14] [16] claim they are fighting a " holy war ", [17] and wish to create an "Emirate" in the Caucasus. [18] Over 5,000 people have been killed and wounded in the Caucasus since 2002. [19]
About 48 hours after the Moscow Metro bombings a double suicide bombing hit the Caucasian Republic of Dagestan , killing the city police chief amongst others. Russia immediately drew parallels, saying the two bombings were linked. [20] On April 1 another bombing in Dagestan killed two more people. [21] On April 5, exactly a week after the Moscow attacks, another bombing in Ingushetia targeting a police barracks drew parallels between that and the Dagestan attacks. It was seen as a fear that these incidents lead to an escalation of violence as a whole. [22]
Locations of the attacks on a metro map
The first explosion occurred on the Red Arrow – 75 years train at the Lubyanka station at approximately 7:56 am local time (3:56 am UTC ). The train started from Yugo-Zapadnaya , and stopped at Lubyanka station. Once the train doors opened, explosives worn by a woman standing at the second carriage's second exit detonated. The explosive had a force of up to 1.5 kg of trinitrotoluene (TNT). [23] Fifteen people on board the train, and eleven people on the platform were killed. One victim from the third carriage died from a head injury caused by an 8 mm (0.31 in) piece of metal. [24]
A second explosion at the Park Kultury station followed at approximately 8:38 am, caused by another female, who at the time of the first explosion was riding another train from Sokolniki station in the same direction. At the time of first explosion, the second train had stopped between Frunzenskaya and Park Kultury stations. It was announced over the speakers that due to technical problems, the train would have to unload the passengers at the next stop. About 40 minutes later, the train reached the station, and once its doors opened, the second female suspect detonated the second explosion, killing fourteen commuters. [24] Panic included stampedes at both stations, as commuters attempted to escape. [9] The second attack was carried out by a dark-haired woman with the equivalent of 2 kg of TNT strapped to her waist. Both bombs were packed with metal nuts, bolts and screws, to increase the destructive impact of the blasts. [25] [26]

The two women who carried out the attacks wore explosive belts, presumably using detonation devices set inside their mobile phones and activated by a call to self. [27] The attackers intended to strike during peak hours on a weekday when the subway would be at capacity. Eyewitnesses said that some survivors were so badly injured that they constantly splashed heavy amounts of blood on the floor and walls, until they were attended to by doctors. [28]
Alexander Bortnikov , the FSB chief, said its investigation pointed to "terrorist groups related to the North Caucasus ". [29]

At least 39 people, aged between 16 and 65, were killed in the explosions. [31] A 40th victim died of her injuries on March 30. [32] [33] This figure was revised upwards from an earlier count of 36 killed, that had consisted of 24 people in the explosion at the Lubyanka station and 12 at Park Kultury. Two other people died in the resulting stampede at both the stations after the blast. Three of the dead were minors. [34]
A high-ranking official of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, Captain Viktor Ginkut, was also amongst the passengers killed at Park Kultury station. [35] His residential registry in Sevastopol , Ukraine has raised the question of his actual nationality, but Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia refused to comment on it. [36]
Over 100 other passengers sustained mild to serious injuries. [9] [27] Five of the injured passengers remained in critical condition for an extended period.
Subsequent false alarms[ edit ]
A third reportedly failed detonation was announced by Life News roughly 40 minutes later, aimed at one of the two Prospekt Mira stations; however, no explosives were found in the plastic bag, after it was taken from the station. [37] Around 10:04 am local time a call from a public phone announcing another planned explosion was made to the Begovaya station staff, but the caller soon revealed it to be a hoax. [38]
Another hoax occurred about an hour after the second explosion at the Ulitsa Podbelskogo station when passengers noticed a Muslim woman entering the train. [39] [40]
Overcrowded surface public transport lines on the day of the bombings
Russian television carried little coverage of the attacks for the first hour after the first explosion took place (at 7:57 am). Commentators have criticised this, alleging that it spread more panic and led to citizens feeling helpless. [41] [42]
Around 11:00 am local time, a special operation was launched to patrol all the subway stations in search of possible clues to trace the instigators. Squads of local police performed passport control at every station of the Sokolnicheskaya Line . [43]
Commuters leave flowers at the Lubyanka station
Russia's Interior Ministry head Rashid Nurgaliyev said security was being boosted across the country, "in particular in those cities with metro systems." [44] March 30 was declared a nationwide Day of Mourning. [45] Prime Minister Vladimir Putin issued a decree ordering the allocation from the Reserve Fund of 300,000 rubles (approx. $11,000 USD) to the families of those killed in the bombings, plus 18,000 rubles for funeral expenses, and of 50,000–100,000 rubles to those who were injured in the attacks, depending on the severity of their injuries. [46] [47]
Authorities have announced that due to upcoming Easter (Paskha), May 1 International Workers Day and May 9 Victory Day , strict security would be imposed on Moscow's metro network up until May 15, 2010. [48] As a result of the terror bombings, the number of daily commuters in the Moscow metro decreased by 17% the next day. [49]
the Moscow metro bombings
According to Interfax news agency, citing law enforcement sources, surveillance cameras captured two women – aged between 18 and 20 – boarding the metro at the Yugo-Zapadnaya station. Police were hunting for one 30-year-old man with North Caucasian features, and two other women of Slavic appearance aged 22 and 45 who had been seen shepherding the bombers into the station. [6] All had their faces uncovered. [50]
Unconfirmed reports said the perpetrators tried to take the explosives to the Russian Ministry of Defense building on Arbat street . [45] Law enforcement also speculated the suicide bombers may have confused the stations, missing one of their original targets – Oktyabrskaya station. They opine that the attackers intended to blow up the Lubyanka station, which is located next to central headquarters of FSB , and then Oktyabrskaya, which is attached to the Ministry of Internal Affairs .

[The] Ministers expressed their deepest sympathy to all who have been injured or bereaved by these attacks, and called for the prosecution of all those responsible." In response, the G8 ministers said they would "continue to collaborate to thwart and constrain terrorists, and to work for a world that is safe for all, based on the principles of democracy, and respect for the rule of law and for human rights." [2]
Secretary General of the Council of Europe , Thorbjørn Jagland , said the attack was an attack on the whole of Europe, and that the terrorists' target was freedom, democracy and the supremacy of law, which are the priority values of the Council of Europe. [3]

He also expressed condolences to the victims' families and wished for a quick recovery to the wounded. He said NATO stays committed to cooperation with Russia in fighting international terrorism. [4]
 Russia
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said: "We will continue the operation against terrorists without hesitation and to the end. It is difficult to prevent such terrorist attacks and to provide security on transport. It is necessary to tighten what we do, to look at the problem on a national scale, not only relating to a certain populated area but on a national scale. Obviously, what we have done before is not enough." [5] After an emergency meeting he ordered senior officials to fight terrorism "without hesitation, to the end." Stating that "The policy to suppress terrorism in our country and the fight with terrorism will be continued."

There should be no indifferent people in the fight against this evil. Evil does not choose its victims on the basis of national, religious, or racial traits ..."During this difficult day for Russia's peoples, we declare with all responsibility that [we] will fight against terrorists until they are completely destroyed. It is impossible to eradicate evil just by persuasion," he said, adding those guilty of the attacks "should be found and punished." [9]

[The] Ministers expressed their deepest sympathy to all who have been injured or bereaved by these attacks, and called for the prosecution of all those responsible." In response, the G8 ministers said they would "continue to collaborate to thwart and constrain terrorists, and to work for a world that is safe for all, based on the principles of democracy, and respect for the rule of law and for human rights." [2]
Secretary General of the Council of Europe , Thorbjørn Jagland , said the attack was an attack on the whole of Europe, and that the terrorists' target was freedom, democracy and the supremacy of law, which are the priority values of the Council of Europe. [3]

[1]

He also expressed condolences to the victims' families and wished for a quick recovery to the wounded. He said NATO stays committed to cooperation with Russia in fighting international terrorism. [4]
 Russia
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said: "We will continue the operation against terrorists without hesitation and to the end. It is difficult to prevent such terrorist attacks and to provide security on transport. It is necessary to tighten what we do, to look at the problem on a national scale, not only relating to a certain populated area but on a national scale. Obviously, what we have done before is not enough." [5] After an emergency meeting he ordered senior officials to fight terrorism "without hesitation, to the end." Stating that "The policy to suppress terrorism in our country and the fight with terrorism will be continued."

There should be no indifferent people in the fight against this evil. Evil does not choose its victims on the basis of national, religious, or racial traits ..."During this difficult day for Russia's peoples, we declare with all responsibility that [we] will fight against terrorists until they are completely destroyed. It is impossible to eradicate evil just by persuasion," he said, adding those guilty of the attacks "should be found and punished." [9]

Moscow Metro Bombings | World History Project The 2010 Moscow Metro bombings were suicide bombings carried out by two women during the morning rush hour of March 29, 2010, at two stations of the Moscow Metro ... Mar 29 2010
Moscow Metro Bombings
With a pair of powerful blasts on Moscow subway cars that killed at least 38 people Monday, two female suicide bombers shattered Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's claim to have contained a separatist insurgency in Russia's southwest and forced the nation's capital to brace for a terrorist comeback after several years of calm.
The explosions occurred about 45 minutes apart at downtown stations during the morning rush hour. They followed triumphant reports in recent weeks that Russian security forces had killed several top leaders of the Islamist rebel movement, which seeks to establish a fundamentalist state in the North Caucasus region.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who cemented his power in 1999 by launching a war to crush Chechen separatism, broke off a trip to Siberia, declaring "terrorists will be destroyed".
Witnesses described panic at two central Moscow stations after the blasts, with morning commuters falling over each other in dense smoke and dust as they tried to escape the worst attack on the Russian capital in six years.
At least 72 others were injured, many gravely, and officials said the death toll could rise. Russia's top security official said the bombs were filled with bolts and iron rods.
At least 38 people were killed and more than 60 injured in two suicide bomb attacks on the Moscow Metro during the morning rush hour, officials say.
Female suicide bombers are believed to have carried out the attacks on trains that had stopped at two stations in the heart of the Russian capital.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for being behind the attacks.
But Russian security services believe the bombers are linked to militant groups in the North Caucasus region.
The 2010 Moscow Metro bombings were suicide bombings carried out by two women during the morning rush hour of March 29, 2010, at two stations of the Moscow Metro (Lubyanka and Park Kultury), with roughly 40 minutes interval between. At least 40 people were killed, and over 100 injured.
Russian officials called the incident "the deadliest and most sophisticated terrorist attack in the Russian capital in six years", a reference to the Avtozavodskaya and Rizhskaya bombings in 2004. At the time of the attacks, an estimated 500,000 people were commuting through Moscow's metro system.
Initial investigation indicated that the bombings were perpetrated by the Islamist Chechen separatists of the Caucasus Emirate. On March 31, Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov confirmed suspicions when he claimed responsibility for ordering the attacks in a video released on the internet. He added that such attacks in Russia would continue. The man who brought the suicide bombers to Moscow was arrested in July 2010. The Anti-Terror Committee of Russia confirmed in August 2010 that Magomedali Vagabov, along with four other militants, was killed in an operation in Dagestan. He is believed to be a militant behind the bombings, a close associate of Doku Umarov and the husband of Mariam Sharipova, one of the two suicide bombers.

On the same day of the attacks, the United States of America's Central Intelligence Agency 's drones killed four people said to be "militants" in the wider tribal area. [1]
A suicide bomber who was said to have been a teenage boy exploded his vest at a mosque in the Ghundai area of Khyber Agency. The mosque was in an area inhabited by Kokikhel tribes who have been opposed to the Taliban activities and have fought to expel them from the region. Mutahir Zeb, a regional government administrator, said that the attack could have been in retaliation and that "many of the wounded succumbed to their injuries, adding to the toll that may rise further as there are still people in critical condition." Khalid Mumtaz Kundi, the deputy chief of the district administration, said that the suicide bomber was wearing 8–10 kg of explosives and was on foot when he exploded his vest in the prayer hall; he also said that ball bearings were used in the attack. According to Al Jazeera the whole mosque compound collapsed with many more worshippers buried under the rubble.
Though no one laid claim to the attack, the Pakistani Taliban were suspected. According to Al Jazeera however, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan's factions said that they do not carry out attacks on mosques. [2]
President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the blast and reiterated the government's stance on dealing with militants "with iron hands;" he added that all those who perpetrate such attacks are inhumane.
Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani also expressed his condemnation and directed the provincial Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to provide the best medical care possible to victims, at the expense of the state. [5]
Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ameer Haider Khan Hoti condemned the blast and termed it as an unhumane and un-Islamic act in the holy month of Ramadan . Expressing grief over the loss of lives, he expressed solidarity with the relatives of the deceased and ordered the administration of local hospitals to ensure ready facilities for the treatment of the injured. [6]
Imran Khan , chairman of the Tehreek-e-Insaaf party, condemned the blasts and attacked the government, accusing it of having badly failed in protecting the people of Pakistan. [7]
The Jamat-e-Islami also condemned the blast, with Syed Munawar Hasan and Liaqat Baloch issuing a joint statement in which they called the bombing a coward and inhumane act "by the enemies of the country and Islam ." They also expressed sympathies with families who had lost their relatives and prayed for the peace of those who had been killed and injured in the bombing. [8]
  United States – Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that "The slaughter of worshippers as they gathered at a mosque for Ramadan's Friday prayers underscores the brutality of those who would target civilians during a time of celebration and reflection for Muslims throughout the world. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones affected by this deplorable violence. The United States deeply respects Pakistan's sacrifices in the fight against extremism and we continue to stand with Pakistan against those who seek to undermine democracy." [1]

On the same day of the attacks, the United States of America's Central Intelligence Agency 's drones killed four people said to be "militants" in the wider tribal area. [1]
A suicide bomber who was said to have been a teenage boy exploded his vest at a mosque in the Ghundai area of Khyber Agency. The mosque was in an area inhabited by Kokikhel tribes who have been opposed to the Taliban activities and have fought to expel them from the region. Mutahir Zeb, a regional government administrator, said that the attack could have been in retaliation and that "many of the wounded succumbed to their injuries, adding to the toll that may rise further as there are still people in critical condition."

The 2010 Philippine Bar exam bombing occurred on Taft Avenue near De La Salle University (DLSU), located in Malate , Manila , Philippines, on September 26, 2010, at 5:05 pm PST , a few minutes after Philippine Bar examinees began exiting DLSU. An Mk2 grenade was thrown at a group of Alpha Phi Beta members from San Beda College . They were standing near Tau Gamma Phi members, who police believed were the real target of the explosive. This resulted in injuries to 47 people, including two who required amputations.
Jed Carlos Lazaga was initially accused of throwing the grenade, based on information received by the Manila Police District (MPD) from an unnamed witness. This theory was later dismissed when the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) took over the case.
Anthony Leal Nepomuceno, NBI's prime suspect and an Alpha Phi Omega (APO) member, surrendered to Jejomar Binay , Vice President of the Philippines , on October 27. Fellow APO members, Binay, and former Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Silvestre Bello III , asserted Nepomuceno's innocence. Binay's actions were criticized by several members of the House of Representatives of the Philippines , who said Nepomuceno was cleared prematurely. The Office of the President stated that it had no intention to distance Binay from the matter, but clarified that Binay's statements would have no bearing in the investigation.
In a 27-page DOJ resolution, prosecutors found Nepomuceno's defense "weak", and recommended his indictment . DOJ charged him with multiple murder charges (for almost killing the two amputees), multiple attempted murder charges, and illegal possession of explosives.
The 2010 Bar exam was the last to be conducted in De La Salle University. The 2011 exam will be held in the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in November. The Supreme Court denied that the bombing precipitated the move; the change had already been planned before the blast. It also said that "necessary security measures" will be in force in UST to prevent an event similar to the 2010 bombing.
Contents
Velasco Hall, one of the buildings used during the Bar exams
De La Salle University is a private La Sallian university located on a 5.45 ha (13.5-acre) campus [1] in Malate, Manila, Philippines. It faces Taft Avenue, a major thoroughfare named after William Howard Taft . DLSU had a population of 888 [2] faculty and 15,779 [3] [4] students in 2009.
The Philippine Bar exams have been held at DLSU since 2002. [5] [6] An average of over 5,000 examinees used its buildings for the test. [7] For the 2010 exam, 5,012 examinees took the test in 121 rooms inside six DLSU buildings. The number of examinees was lower than the 6,080 who took the test in 2009. [8]
Incident and response[ edit ]
The bar exam ended at 5 pm PST . As with tradition, examinees were expected to be greeted by loud noises as they exit DLSU. [9] By 5:05 pm, a loud explosion occurred in the area where supporters for the San Beda College examinees were standing. Tremors were felt as far away as inside the elevated platform of the Vito Cruz LRT Station near DLSU. People in the area thought that the noise from the explosion was from fireworks that are a normal part of the post-bar celebrations. A commotion followed as people panicked and ran for safety. A bottle-throwing incident also occurred, according to a police spokesman. [10] [11] The window of a street-side shop was shattered. Glass bottles, broken and intact, were scattered around the area as police evacuated people from the scene. The explosion occurred shortly after a fraternity fight near DLSU. [12]
On the day of the explosion, 34 injuries were reported. This figure rose to 47 two days later. [13] Most of the victims were female and members of Alpha Phi Beta, a fraternity from San Beda. [14] Victims who were identified were from 23 to 28 years old. Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center received 17 of the injured; nine were taken to the Philippine General Hospital , five to Medical Center Manila , three to the Manila Doctors Hospital , and one to the Manila Adventist Medical Center . [10] [15] The Manila Police District bomb squad rushed to the site of the blast and cordoned off the area to search the debris for parts of the explosive. [11]
Two persons (Raissa Laurel and Joanna Ledda; [9] both women) underwent leg amputations because of their injuries. [13]
We, legitimate fraternities based in major universities and colleges as well as communities nationwide, joins [ sic ] the Filipino nation in condemning in the strongest possible terms the brutal act of indiscriminate violence, which occurred during street revelry along Taft Avenue marking the end of this year’s bar examinations at the De La Salle University. We denounce this gross display of brutality, which caused severe injury to innocent people and damage to property.
The bombing was condemned by the Supreme Court of the Philippines , who called it "an unfortunate incident." [17] The incident was likewise condemned by San Beda Rector Aloysius Maranan, [18] Akbayan Youth Chairperson Marlon Cornelio, and Negros fraternities . [19] Several members of six fraternities gathered at Quezon City on October 1 to participate in a candlelighting event and express their sympathies. [16]
Renato Corona , Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , said in a statement that he had already ordered the Supreme Court security, the MPD, and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to investigate the matter and "to identify the perpetrators of this senseless act of cowardice, and bring them to the bar of justice." He also ordered a review of the security protocol. Task Force Bar Operations 2010 was created to specifically investigate the incident. [20]
After visiting a number of victims two days after the incident, President Benigno Aquino III called the attack a "heinous crime", as many of the victims were "preparing for their future as productive citizens of our country." He called for the investigators to make the case their top priority, and for the perpetrator to surrender. [21] [22]
On October 3 the Fraternal Order of Utopia from Ateneo de Manila University offered a ₱200,000 (US$4,620) [23] -reward to anyone who could present information identifying the perpetrator. [24] Several anonymous donors offered an additional reward of ₱1 million (US$23,100) the next day. [23] [25] [26] Meanwhile, the Supreme Court created an eight-person investigation committee tasked with making a report by October 15. [21] [22] [24] [27]
The ID recovered from Jed Carlo Lazaga
Initial police reports considered improvised explosive devices , fireworks, Molotov cocktails , and fragmentation grenades to be possible causes of the explosion. [15] [20] Reports point to a possible cause of the incident to be a conflict between Alpha Phi Omega and Tau Gamma Phi . Armando Macaraeg, chief of the MPD Homicide Division, said that the real targets of the explosion were members of Tau Gamma Phi, and the perpetrator misfired, causing the explosive to hit Alpha Phi Beta members, who were standing nearby. [9]
MPD received from an unnamed witness, who was slightly injured by the blast, reports of a man in black jacket and white shirt bearing the emblem of Alpha Kappa Rho . This man allegedly threw the explosive from the other side of Taft Avenue, aiming for Tau Gamma Phi members; the throw fell short, hitting the San Beda students instead. [9] People went after the alleged bomber and cornered him. Identification found on the man indicated he was Jed Carlo Lazaga of University of San Jose–Recoletos in Cebu . The witness said that they were not able to surrender the man to the police, because Lazaga's companions carried guns and threatened to shoot people. Lazaga reportedly filed a mauling complaint. [28]
On September 28 the NBI had three unnamed suspects, and had identified the explosive as a Mk2 grenade . On the same day, NBI questioned Alpha Kappa Rho officials, [21] and expressed interest in summoning other fraternities that were present during the incident. [29] Alpha Kappa Rho President Jojo del Rosario acknowledged Lazaga's membership in the fraternity, and revealed that Lazaga is a fourth-year law student. He denied Lazaga's involvement in the blast, saying "why would he even complain to the police if he is guilty? He even lost his wallet, was mauled even" (trans). Del Rosario and his group presented pictures of Lazaga with at least 20 law students and professors of the university before the explosion. Lazaga was shown to be wearing a white shirt with a graphic design, contrary to the witness's claim. [30] This theory was no longer pursued when the NBI took over the MPD investigation. [31]
Identification and surrender to Binay[ edit ]
On October 19 the NBI released an artist's sketch of the suspect and several other details. The suspect was said to be a 20- to 25-year old male of medium build 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m) to 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m) in height and weighing 60–65 kilograms (132–143 lb). [26] The suspect was given one week to surrender. [32]
Many of those investigated are APO, including him [Nepomuceno]. We are disappointed that he is being accused but based on our interrogation and according to him, I think he is not at fault.
Anthony Leal Nepomuceno, NBI's prime suspect, surrendered to Jejomar Binay , Vice President of the Philippines and an APO member, on October 27. [32] [33] [34] [35] At the time, Nepomuceno was a 26-year old call center agent who graduated with a degree in information technology from Manuel L. Quezon University ; he was also a member of APO. Nepomuceno denied all accusations. [36] APO defended his innocence, and formed a legal team in response to the NBI complaints. [26] He said that he was inside a mall in Marikina at 5 pm buying shoes—at the same time as the bombing—and withdrew money from a bank at 7:30 pm. [37]
Binay insisted that Nepomuceno was innocent. This position was acknowledged by former Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Silvestre Bello III , who earlier pledged to help prosecute him if the evidence was strong. [30] [35] [38] [39] Upon the request of DOJ Secretary Leila de Lima , Binay presented Nepomuceno to the NBI on October 28. [33] [36]
I'm not saying that Nepomuceno is guilty ... the suspect can be cleared upon investigation or probable cause may be found to charge him. So, therefore, I think it would be premature for anybody to say he is innocent.
De Lima said that Nepomuceno matches the artist's sketch and the description given earlier, and the evidence against him is strong, as the NBI has at least 17 witnesses. [34] She revealed that an NBI team had earlier gone to Nepomuceno's mother in Marinduque ; his mother initially agreed to convince her son to surrender, but later refused to tell his whereabouts. [33] De Lima clarified that Nepomuceno was merely "invited for questioning and not under arrest", since no charges had been filed yet. [36] [38]
On October 28 the NBI filed to the DOJ numerous complaints of frustrated and attempted murder against Nepomuceno based on the testimonies that Nepomuceno threw the grenade. Police studied the possibility that the incident was linked to a fraternity rumble in December 2009, when Cromwell Dukha Jr. from APO was fatally stabbed, allegedly by Efraim Lim, a member of Tau Gamma Phi. Both were from San Sebastian College . Filing the complaint paved way for the start of the preliminary investigation by the DOJ. More suspects were being considered by the NBI as of the time of filing the complaints. [26]
On November 10 the DOJ identified two more APO members as suspects. Their names were not revealed. NBI believes that the two are responsible for Nepomuceno's escape during the incident. De Lima said that ongoing investigations on grenade-throwing incidents at La Consolacion College in 2008 and University of Perpetual Help System DALTA also suggest APO involvement. The two bombings left 22 and 14 wounded, respectively. [42] She noted an "apparent lack of interest" on the part of the APO leadership to cooperate in the investigation. [31] [43] [44]
On the same day, APO responded:
It disappoints us that we cannot really cooperate with Secretary De Lima because when she once said that two APO members were accomplices, they did not even identify who the two were, of the over 150,000 APO members.
—Ferdie Ramos (APO spokesperson), 
trans. from Sun.Star [45]
In a 27-page resolution signed by Prosecutor Gerardo Gaerlan and Senior Deputy State Prosecutor Richard Anthony Fadullon, DOJ found Nepomuceno's defense to be "weak", and recommended for his indictment on April 28, 2011. He was not able to prove that it was physically impossible for him to be present at the time of the bombing, and witnesses were positive that he is the person who threw the grenade. The DOJ said that Nepomuceno's submission of a photocopy of a receipt from a Metrobank ATM in Marikina does not prove his claim that he was not at Taft during the bombing, since the time on the receipt was more than two hours after the bombing. [46] [47] The resolution stated:
Considering that the scene of the crime is at Taft Avenue, Manila, which is more or less 20 kilometers away from Baranka, Marikina, then, it is not physically impossible for the respondent to be at the scene of the crime when the crime was committed, because his alibi of being in Marikina City happened only two hours after the crime was committed.
—DOJ resolution on the bombing, 
Nepomuceno submitted testimonies to support his claim, but these were dismissed by Gaerlan. He noted that these were mostly from family, friends, and fellow fraternity members. Nepomuceno accused the DOJ investigation of being "irregular and selective" for disregarding other suspects, and labeled one witnesses' statement as "ill-motivated", since the witness was from a rival fraternity. Gaerlan defended the claims as being "evidentiary in nature." [47]
He faces charges of multiple murder (for almost killing the two amputees), multiple attempted murder, [46] [47] and illegal possession of explosives. [48]
Raissa Laurel, a 23-year old law student from San Sebastian College who lost both her legs due to the event, was given an award for her "courage and strength" by People Asia on its 11th anniversary on January 10. The award was presented by President Benigno Aquino III. [49] Meanwhile, Chief Justice Renato Corona of the Supreme Court pledged to personally administer Laurel's oath-taking once she passes the bar. He promised that the Supreme Court will hire her when she recovers. [50] Nippon Foundation promised to give her prosthetic legs on her birthday on April 23, 2011. [51] She was released from the Philippine General Hospital on November 7, 2010. [52]
The 2010 Bar exam was the last to be conducted at De La Salle University. [6] [53] The 2011 exam was held in the University of Santo Tomas in November; DLSU ended its contract with the Supreme Court due to construction plans on the campus. Supreme Court spokesman Midas Marquez denied that the bombing was the reason behind the move; the move had been already planned before the blast. He also said that "necessary security measures" will be in force at UST to prevent an event similar to the 2010 bombing. [5]

After visiting a number of victims two days after the incident, President Benigno Aquino III called the attack a "heinous crime", as many of the victims were "preparing for their future as productive citizens of our country." He called for the investigators to make the case their top priority, and for the perpetrator to surrender. [21] [22]
On October 3 the Fraternal Order of Utopia from Ateneo de Manila University offered a ₱200,000 (US$4,620) [23] -reward to anyone who could present information identifying the perpetrator. [24] Several anonymous donors offered an additional reward of ₱1 million (US$23,100) the next day. [23] [25] [26] Meanwhile, the Supreme Court created an eight-person investigation committee tasked with making a report by October 15. [21] [22] [24] [27]
The ID recovered from Jed Carlo Lazaga
Initial police reports considered improvised explosive devices , fireworks, Molotov cocktails , and fragmentation grenades to be possible causes of the explosion. [15] [20] Reports point to a possible cause of the incident to be a conflict between Alpha Phi Omega and Tau Gamma Phi . Armando Macaraeg, chief of the MPD Homicide Division, said that the real targets of the explosion were members of Tau Gamma Phi, and the perpetrator misfired, causing the explosive to hit Alpha Phi Beta members, who were standing nearby. [9]
MPD received from an unnamed witness, who was slightly injured by the blast, reports of a man in black jacket and white shirt bearing the emblem of Alpha Kappa Rho . This man allegedly threw the explosive from the other side of Taft Avenue, aiming for Tau Gamma Phi members; the throw fell short, hitting the San Beda students instead. [9] People went after the alleged bomber and cornered him. Identification found on the man indicated he was Jed Carlo Lazaga of University of San Jose–Recoletos in Cebu . The witness said that they were not able to surrender the man to the police, because Lazaga's companions carried guns and threatened to shoot people. Lazaga reportedly filed a mauling complaint. [28]
On September 28 the NBI had three unnamed suspects, and had identified the explosive as a Mk2 grenade . On the same day, NBI questioned Alpha Kappa Rho officials, [21] and expressed interest in summoning other fraternities that were present during the incident. [29] Alpha Kappa Rho President Jojo del Rosario acknowledged Lazaga's membership in the fraternity, and revealed that Lazaga is a fourth-year law student. He denied Lazaga's involvement in the blast, saying "why would he even complain to the police if he is guilty? He even lost his wallet, was mauled even" (trans). Del Rosario and his group presented pictures of Lazaga with at least 20 law students and professors of the university before the explosion. Lazaga was shown to be wearing a white shirt with a graphic design, contrary to the witness's claim. [30] This theory was no longer pursued when the NBI took over the MPD investigation. [31]
Identification and surrender to Binay[ edit ]
On October 19 the NBI released an artist's sketch of the suspect and several other details. The suspect was said to be a 20- to 25-year old male of medium build 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m) to 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m) in height and weighing 60–65 kilograms (132–143 lb). [26] The suspect was given one week to surrender. [32]
Many of those investigated are APO, including him [Nepomuceno]. We are disappointed that he is being accused but based on our interrogation and according to him, I think he is not at fault.
Anthony Leal Nepomuceno, NBI's prime suspect, surrendered to Jejomar Binay , Vice President of the Philippines and an APO member, on October 27. [32] [33] [34] [35] At the time, Nepomuceno was a 26-year old call center agent who graduated with a degree in information technology from Manuel L. Quezon University ; he was also a member of APO. Nepomuceno denied all accusations. [36] APO defended his innocence, and formed a legal team in response to the NBI complaints. [26] He said that he was inside a mall in Marikina at 5 pm buying shoes—at the same time as the bombing—and withdrew money from a bank at 7:30 pm. [37]
Binay insisted that Nepomuceno was innocent. This position was acknowledged by former Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Silvestre Bello III , who earlier pledged to help prosecute him if the evidence was strong. [30] [35] [38] [39] Upon the request of DOJ Secretary Leila de Lima , Binay presented Nepomuceno to the NBI on October 28. [33] [36]
I'm not saying that Nepomuceno is guilty ... the suspect can be cleared upon investigation or probable cause may be found to charge him. So, therefore, I think it would be premature for anybody to say he is innocent.
De Lima said that Nepomuceno matches the artist's sketch and the description given earlier, and the evidence against him is strong, as the NBI has at least 17 witnesses. [34] She revealed that an NBI team had earlier gone to Nepomuceno's mother in Marinduque ; his mother initially agreed to convince her son to surrender, but later refused to tell his whereabouts. [33] De Lima clarified that Nepomuceno was merely "invited for questioning and not under arrest", since no charges had been filed yet. [36] [38]
On October 28 the NBI filed to the DOJ numerous complaints of frustrated and attempted murder against Nepomuceno based on the testimonies that Nepomuceno threw the grenade. Police studied the possibility that the incident was linked to a fraternity rumble in December 2009, when Cromwell Dukha Jr. from APO was fatally stabbed, allegedly by Efraim Lim, a member of Tau Gamma Phi. Both were from San Sebastian College . Filing the complaint paved way for the start of the preliminary investigation by the DOJ. More suspects were being considered by the NBI as of the time of filing the complaints. [26]
On November 10 the DOJ identified two more APO members as suspects. Their names were not revealed. NBI believes that the two are responsible for Nepomuceno's escape during the incident. De Lima said that ongoing investigations on grenade-throwing incidents at La Consolacion College in 2008 and University of Perpetual Help System DALTA also suggest APO involvement. The two bombings left 22 and 14 wounded, respectively. [42] She noted an "apparent lack of interest" on the part of the APO leadership to cooperate in the investigation. [31] [43] [44]
On the same day, APO responded:
It disappoints us that we cannot really cooperate with Secretary De Lima because when she once said that two APO members were accomplices, they did not even identify who the two were, of the over 150,000 APO members.
—Ferdie Ramos (APO spokesperson), 
trans. from Sun.Star [45]
In a 27-page resolution signed by Prosecutor Gerardo Gaerlan and Senior Deputy State Prosecutor Richard Anthony Fadullon, DOJ found Nepomuceno's defense to be "weak", and recommended for his indictment on April 28, 2011. He was not able to prove that it was physically impossible for him to be present at the time of the bombing, and witnesses were positive that he is the person who threw the grenade. The DOJ said that Nepomuceno's submission of a photocopy of a receipt from a Metrobank ATM in Marikina does not prove his claim that he was not at Taft during the bombing, since the time on the receipt was more than two hours after the bombing. [46] [47] The resolution stated:
Considering that the scene of the crime is at Taft Avenue, Manila, which is more or less 20 kilometers away from Baranka, Marikina, then, it is not physically impossible for the respondent to be at the scene of the crime when the crime was committed, because his alibi of being in Marikina City happened only two hours after the crime was committed.
—DOJ resolution on the bombing, 
Nepomuceno submitted testimonies to support his claim, but these were dismissed by Gaerlan. He noted that these were mostly from family, friends, and fellow fraternity members. Nepomuceno accused the DOJ investigation of being "irregular and selective" for disregarding other suspects, and labeled one witnesses' statement as "ill-motivated", since the witness was from a rival fraternity. Gaerlan defended the claims as being "evidentiary in nature." [47]
He faces charges of multiple murder (for almost killing the two amputees), multiple attempted murder, [46] [47] and illegal possession of explosives. [48]
Raissa Laurel, a 23-year old law student from San Sebastian College who lost both her legs due to the event, was given an award for her "courage and strength" by People Asia on its 11th anniversary on January 10. The award was presented by President Benigno Aquino III. [49] Meanwhile, Chief Justice Renato Corona of the Supreme Court pledged to personally administer Laurel's oath-taking once she passes the bar. He promised that the Supreme Court will hire her when she recovers. [50] Nippon Foundation promised to give her prosthetic legs on her birthday on April 23, 2011. [51] She was released from the Philippine General Hospital on November 7, 2010. [52]
The 2010 Bar exam was the last to be conducted at De La Salle University. [6] [53] The 2011 exam was held in the University of Santo Tomas in November; DLSU ended its contract with the Supreme Court due to construction plans on the campus. Supreme Court spokesman Midas Marquez denied that the bombing was the reason behind the move; the move had been already planned before the blast. He also said that "necessary security measures" will be in force at UST to prevent an event similar to the 2010 bombing. [5]

(a) the prose is clear and concise, it respects copyright laws , and the spelling and grammar are correct;
Lead
What theory? (second paragraph)
A couple of the paragraphs (second and third especially) may need to be merged.
Incident and response
"People in the area thought that the noise from the explosion was from fireworks that are a normal part of the post-bar celebrations. A commotion followed as people panicked and ran for safety." - Wouldn't they have to realize that it was a bomb first?
Manila Doctors Hospital - does it not have an apostrophe? (i.e. not Manila Doctors' Hospital ?)
The third paragraph should probably be merged with the second, near the casualties figure.
Lazaga accused
Instead of writing (trans) after a translated quote, perhaps you should use {{ cref }}, like used in Sitti Nurbaya so that the original can be read as well, but not intrude on the text.

Posted at 09/27/2010 4:03 PM | Updated as of 09/27/2010 5:41 PM
MANILA, Philippines - The Supreme Court on Monday condemned the acts of violence by alleged warring fraternities near De La Salle University campus in Manila during Sunday’s closing of the 2010 Bar exams.
In a statement, Chief Justice Renato Corona said he has ordered the Supreme Court Security, the Manila Police District and the National Bureau of Investigation to look at all possible angles "to identify the perpetrators of this senseless act of cowardice, and bring them to the bar of justice."
"The Chief Justice sympathizes with the victims of the explosion and has directed Court Officials to attend to the victims' medical needs," he said.
The Supreme Court Public Information Office and Security Division have turned over to the investigators a video of the incident, and statements of eyewitnesses.
The High Court encouraged other witnesses to come forward and shed light on the incident for a more comprehensive investigation.
The Chief Justice has also called for a review of the security protocol, not only within the venue of the bar examinations where everything went on smoothly, but also in its periphery to prevent the occurrence of similar accidents.
Justice Conchita Carpio Morales, chairperson of the 2010 Bar Examinations, has assured everyone that the unfortunate incident will not in any way hamper or delay the checking of the examination booklets and the release of the results.  
Grenade may have caused clash
Police said a member of a fraternity may have thrown a grenade at a rival group during Sunday’s closing of the 2010 Bar exams.
At least 44 were reported hurt when a melee erupted near the De La Salle University campus in Manila, where thousands have convened for the traditional Bar operations.
In an interview with ANC, Manila Police District officer-in-charge Chief Superintendent Roberto Rongavilla said “an unofficial information (I got), there is a sketch account of a male person wearing a t-shirt with Greek letter emblem ‘AKRHO’ who then threw the suspected bomb at [the] Tau Gamma fraternity.”
Police earlier ruled out terrorism, saying a fraternity war may likely be the case behind the incident.
Rongavilla said “theoretically, we really thought it was a pillbox. On the other hand, we also thought it was a Molotov bomb. It could also be a grenade. This will be revealed later.”
He said they are now coordinating with hospital officials to confirm this theory.
“Last night, we gave instructions [to the police] to coordinate with the hospitals. That if there’s shrapnel found in the victims, it should be preserved,” he said.
The injured were brought to the Ospital ng Maynila and the Manila Adventist Hospital.
He said the police are still in the thick of threshing out the events that happened on Sunday.
A taskforce has already been created to specifically focus on the matter, called the “Task Force Bar Operations 2010.”
The taskforce intends to release the investigation results late Monday or Tuesday.

2 law students lose legs in Bar exam bombing | ABS-CBN News ... that hit the final day of the 2010 Bar exams ... 2 law students lose legs in Bar exam bombing. abs-cbnNEWS.com. ... at Philippine General ... abs-cbnNEWS.com
Posted at 09/27/2010 7:58 PM | Updated as of 09/28/2010 1:37 AM
MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – A female law student lost both her legs while another one had to have one of her legs amputated following the blast that hit the final day of the 2010 Bar exams in Manila on Sunday. 
Doctors amputated both legs of one of the victims, Raissa Laurel, because of severe injuries caused by an explosion outside the De La Salle University (DLSU) campus in Taft Avenue, Manila.
The 25-year-old Laurel, a 2nd year law student at San Sebastian College, was among the 44 people injured in a melee between alleged warring fraternities.
She is now recovering at Philippine General Hospital’s (PGH) intensive care unit.
Writing her answers to questions from ABS-CBN's Julius Babao, Laurel said that she was in the “wrong place at the wrong time.”
She, however, was thankful for being given a chance for a “second life.”
She said a bomb placed inside a small box exploded in front of her. However, she did not see who threw the bomb. 
Laurel plans to continue her studies. 
“I still want to become a lawyer someday,” she said in handwritten notes she gave to ABS-CBN News.
Her father, Roberto Laurel, was in tears while he described the pain of knowing that her daughter lost her legs.
“Another doctor, ‘yung anesthesiologist niya… approached me and explained, and he told me that my daughter would [live to] be a lawyer. So that was the happiest news last night,” he said. 
“Naaawa ako, pero she has that spirit of....definitely, one day she will become a lawyer. Iyon pong spirit na iyon, at ang kanyang ambisyon, I hope it is not totally ruined with what has happened to her,” he added. “At least she would live, but I know na yung dating… confidence, I don’t know if she could gain back that confidence.”
He urged the government to bring the perpetrators to justice.
“Gawan po natin ng aksyon ang pangyayaring ito. We are in a civilized world, and I believe that with what has happened yesterday, anarchy na po ang nangyayari eh… I appeal to the government, most especially to the Supreme Court… I’m sorry if I’m barking at the wrong tree pero sa tingin ko, sa inyo po ito, tigilan na po natin ang ganito,” Laurel said.
He thanked people who donated blood for her daughter. 
The donors include Raissa’s classmates, friends, and Private First Class (Pfc.) Arnold Delanatar and Pfc. Alfeo Jordan.
The 2 soldiers said they do not know the victim personally, and only heard word that she needed blood transfusion. They waited for 8 hours at the PGH to donate blood.
Jordan said they felt bad over what happened to the bombing victim. “Wala naman siyang kasalanan,” he added.
Delantar said Raissa thanked them by waving at them. 
Two other female law students who were also hit by the blast are still confined at the Manila Doctors’ Hospital (MDH).
One of them had to have her left leg amputated. Doctors, who declined to reveal her name, said they are still trying to save her right leg and left hand.
The 2 victims suffered shrapnel and burn wounds, doctors said. They are set to go under the knife again on Wednesday.
Twelve blast victims, who are students of San Beda College, were brought to the MDH. Seven were still receiving treatment, as of this writing. 
Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona on Monday condemned the acts of violence, and ordered the Supreme Court Security, the Manila Police District (MPD), and the National Bureau of Investigation to go after those behind the incident.
Akrho tagged
MPD officer-in-charge Chief Superintendent Roberto Rongavilla said police received information that a man “wearing a t-shirt with Greek letter emblem ‘Akrho’… threw the suspected bomb at [the] Tau Gamma fraternity.”
“Meron silang na-notice, itong ating mga witnesses, na iyong suspected na naghagis ng explosive ay may nakasulat na Akrho, at based sa investigation, ang target ay ang Tau Gamma Phi, kaya lang medyo na-missed nila ang target so natapon ito sa Alpha Phi Beta ng mostly San Beda law students,” Rongavilla said.
He added that police have secured a new video footage that may help shed light on the incident.
He said police are still trying to determine the type of explosive used in the incident.
A witness told ABS-CBN News that before the explosion, he saw a group of men in the area who were covering their faces. 
When people tried to accost the group, one of the men allegedly pulled out a grenade. 
“Sumisiksik po siya sa mga tao, tapos nakita namin na meron po siyang dinukot sa bag niya na Granada, tapos hinugot, tapos ginanon niya po niya sa ilalim. Pagkababa niya po, bigla na pong sumabog,” said the witness.
People went after the alleged bomber and cornered him. 
An ID found on the man showed his name as Jed Carlo Lazaga of the University of San Jose Recoletos in Cebu.  
He was reportedly wearing a jacket bearing the insignia of the Akrho fraternity.
The witness said they were not able to surrender the man to police because the suspects’ companions had a gun and threatened to shoot people. 
Lazaga has reportedly approached police to file a mauling complaint. 
“Inatasan ko nga ang hepe ng Station 9 to exhaust all available means na ma-invite nila ‘yung tao and makapagbigay-liwanag sa nasabing insidente,” MPD District 2 head Superintendent Ernesto Fojas said.
Fraternity head denies involvement
Alpha Kappa Rho fraternity national council president Jojo de Rosario, meanwhile, denied allegations that one of their members was behind the blast. 
He said Lazaga is not a member of their fraternity.
He added that Akrho officials would immediately know if their members are involved in the incident. 
“We’re trying to professionalize the organization. Walang aggression na mag-start sa amin,” del Rosario said.
He said he was in the area during the incident to support Beta Sigma Lambda fraternity members, who were having their exams. 
Del Rosario said he was crossing Taft Avenue when he heard an explosion. 
“Biglang may sumigaw na babae, na sabi niya, ‘harangin niyo ‘yun, harangin nyo.’ Ang nakita ko, dumaan sa akin, tumatakbo,” he said. 
He claimed that he tried to block the unidentified man, whose face was covered with a large handkerchief.

<h1>2 law students lose legs in Bar exam bombing | ABS-CBN News </h1>

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – A female law student lost both her legs while another one had to have one of her legs amputated following the blast that hit the final day of the 2010 Bar exams in Manila on Sunday. 
Doctors amputated both legs of one of the victims, Raissa Laurel, because of severe injuries caused by an explosion outside the De La Salle University (DLSU) campus in Taft Avenue, Manila.
The 25-year-old Laurel, a 2nd year law student at San Sebastian College, was among the 44 people injured in a melee between alleged warring fraternities.
She is now recovering at Philippine General Hospital’s (PGH) intensive care unit.
Writing her answers to questions from ABS-CBN's Julius Babao, Laurel said that she was in the “wrong place at the wrong time.”
She, however, was thankful for being given a chance for a “second life.”
She said a bomb placed inside a small box exploded in front of her. However, she did not see who threw the bomb. 
Laurel plans to continue her studies. 
“I still want to become a lawyer someday,” she said in handwritten notes she gave to ABS-CBN News.
Her father, Roberto Laurel, was in tears while he described the pain of knowing that her daughter lost her legs.
“Another doctor, ‘yung anesthesiologist niya… approached me and explained, and he told me that my daughter would [live to] be a lawyer. So that was the happiest news last night,” he said. 
“Naaawa ako, pero she has that spirit of....definitely, one day she will become a lawyer. Iyon pong spirit na iyon, at ang kanyang ambisyon, I hope it is not totally ruined with what has happened to her,” he added. “At least she would live, but I know na yung dating… confidence, I don’t know if she could gain back that confidence.”
He urged the government to bring the perpetrators to justice.
“Gawan po natin ng aksyon ang pangyayaring ito. We are in a civilized world, and I believe that with what has happened yesterday, anarchy na po ang nangyayari eh… I appeal to the government, most especially to the Supreme Court… I’m sorry if I’m barking at the wrong tree pero sa tingin ko, sa inyo po ito, tigilan na po natin ang ganito,” Laurel said.
He thanked people who donated blood for her daughter. 
The donors include Raissa’s classmates, friends, and Private First Class (Pfc.) Arnold Delanatar and Pfc. Alfeo Jordan.
The 2 soldiers said they do not know the victim personally, and only heard word that she needed blood transfusion. They waited for 8 hours at the PGH to donate blood.
Jordan said they felt bad over what happened to the bombing victim. “Wala naman siyang kasalanan,” he added.

2010 Badakhshan massacre - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 2010 Badakhshan massacre. From Wikipedia, the free ... Nuristan Eye Camp team were killed in Kuran wa Munjan District of Badakhshan Province in Afghanistan. ... Unknown
On 5 August 2010, ten members of International Assistance Mission (IAM) Nuristan Eye Camp team were killed in Kuran wa Munjan District of Badakhshan Province in Afghanistan. [1] [2] The team was attacked as it was returning from Nuristan to Kabul. One team member was spared, the rest of the team were killed immediately. Those killed were six Americans, two Afghans, one Briton and one German. [3]
The identity of the attackers is unknown. When news of the killings broke, both Hizb-e Islami and the Taliban initially claimed responsibility for the attack, [2] accusing the doctors of proselytism and spying. [4] [5] [6] These claims were later refuted by Taliban leaders in Nuristan and Badakhshan, who stated that they had confirmed the dead were bona-fide aid workers, condemned the killings as murder, and offered their condolences to the families of those killed. [7]
The attack was the deadliest strike against foreign aid workers in the Afghanistan war . [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The killings underscored the suspicion Christian-affiliated groups face from some Afghans and government opponents and the wider risks faced by aid workers in the country. [13]

Background and context[ edit ]
Badakhshan province borders Tajikistan and is inhabited by mostly Tajik people . It is one of the few provinces in Afghanistan which was not controlled by the Taliban when it was in power. [14] After coming under increasing pressure by NATO forces in southern Afghanistan the Taliban have become active in areas like Badakhshan Province which were previously calm. In addition they have started using women and children as suicide bombers and targeted tribal elders, things they formerly considered taboo. [2] Foreign aid workers have been attacked in the past but these attacks have been relatively infrequent and Taliban has allowed some aid workers in the areas they controlled. [9] Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission stated that civilian deaths were up five percent in 2010 and Taliban was responsible for 68% of the 1325 deaths till 8 August 2010 and NATO was responsible for 28%. [15] IAM is a Christian organization that has worked in Afghanistan since 1966. They have denied proselytizing , [16] as for non-Muslims it is against the law of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. According to critics propagandists of the Taliban insurgency portray their drive for power as a defense of Islam. The victims of the massacre had indeed been sponsored by a Christian charity, but that organization worked in Afghanistan since 1966, under a monarchy, a communist regime, warlords, and under the Taliban; its aid workers were said to understand the Afghan customs and sensibilities and have scrupulously obeyed prohibitions against proselytizing. [17] None of the Christian non-profit's workers had ever been killed while on duty with the organisation. [18]
The publicity on the massacre and its aftermath coincided with the publication of the 2010 Mid-Year Report on Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), [19] [20] [21] in which worries were expressed about the rising number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan and that was directly followed by an advice of human rights organisation Amnesty International that the Taliban should be prosecuted for war crimes . [22] According to the UNAMA report, the tactics of the Taliban and other Anti-Government Elements (AGEs) were behind a 31 per cent increase in conflict-related civilian casualties in the first six months of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Casualties attributed to Pro-Government Forces (PGF) fell 30 per cent during the same period, driven by a 64 per cent decline in deaths and injuries caused by aerial attacks. Many Afghans blame the international forces for the civilian deaths, "stirring up greater violence by fomenting new recruits for the Taliban, for arming militias in the countryside, and for propping up warlords and corrupt Afghan officials". [23] [24] [25]
The team, which included a doctor, a dentist and an optometrist, was returning to Kabul after providing eye care to villagers in Parun valley in Nuristan Province , south of Badakhshan Province in Northeast Afghanistan. [11] They had been running an eye camp in Nuristan, for which they had received permission from the Afghan government. They had chosen to travel through a forest in Badakhshan as this was considered a safer route back to Kabul. The team was attacked when they stopped after fording a river. They were killed immediately, without any negotiation. One Afghan driver was spared after he started chanting verses from the Qur'an . [2] When the bodies were recovered, the victims appeared to have been robbed. [14] The two Afghans killed worked as a watchman and a cook. The bodies of the victims were flown back to Kabul on 8 August 2010. [15] The foreigners killed were all unpaid volunteers. [14]
Mahram Ali, aged 51 years, [27] of the Hazara ethnic minority, from Wardak , Afghanistan, was a civilian contractor that had been a worker at the National Organisation for Ophthalmic Rehabilitation ’s (NOOR's) maintenance workshop since 2007; [28] he served as a driver for the expedition, and as "watcher", to guard team vehicles. [28] [29] In this service to IAM , Ali drove and “stayed behind guarding the vehicles in Nawa when the rest of the team walked over the pass into Nuristan.” [28] Ali was described as "the only person to care for his family” by Rahim Majid, the operations manager at IAM. [29] Ali was also survived by a wife and three young children, [28] [29] including one son paralyzed by polio and an another son whose arm had been amputated, all supported on his monthly $150 salary.

[34] [35] [36] Carderelli had been working for the International School of Kabul , and documenting aid work done by the IAM and other groups. [35] A statement released by his family said that Calderelli "loved people and was particularly concerned for the poor". [35] [36] He was a lifelong member of Covenant Presbyterian Church in Harrisonburg, [35] and a 2009 graduate of James Madison University and was approaching the one year anniversary of his service in Afghanistan. [35] [36] According to his family, “Brian quickly fell in love with the Afghan people and culture and hoped to stay within the country for another year,” [35] and was compiling a photographic and video album entitled "The Beauty – It's Not All War." [35] [36]
Thomas Grams, aged 51 years, [27] of Durango, Colorado , United States, friend of team leader Tom Little, began to work in dentistry for impoverished children about 10 years before his death, via Denver -based agency Global Dental Relief (GDR). [27] [37] One of native twin brothers and dentists from Park Rapids, Minnesota, [38] Grams left their "thriving" private general dentistry practice in Durango in 2007 to join GDR full-time, [27] [37] [39] [40] going first to Nepal ("trekk[ing]... halfway up... Everest, carrying dental equipment by yak" [27] ), [37] and then several times to Afghanistan, initially as a volunteer, later as team leader. [37] [38] [40] Significant Afghanistan efforts included providing free dental care in the village Wardak, "negotiat[ing] the etiquette of the burka" to found a Kabul dental clinic (employing a local female dentist), [27] [39] and participating in English teaching at a local school. [39] "[U]nassuming and modest," Grams was described by the IAM as "one of our favorit[e]" aid workers. [37]
Jawed, known by this single name, aged 24 years, [27] from Panjshir , Afghanistan, was a civilian contractor that had been at the Eye Hospital of the Afghan Ministry of Public Health in Kabul, and was given leave to serve as the team cook at its Eye Camp. [41] This was not his first service with IAM , where he cooked and helped with dispensing eyeglasses; per the IAM, “Jawed had been on several eye camps into Nuristan in the past, and was well loved for his sense of humor,” [41] and was known for providing his collection of music tapes for weddings and parties. [27] The principal breadwinner for his wife, three young children, and extended family, [27] [41] Jawed had been excited about the $20-a-day in overtime that he was earning on the medical outreach trip. [27] Jawed’s brother Abdul Bagin described his killers as "infidels; not human, not Muslims... [killing] without any judgment, without any trial”. [27]
Glen D. Lapp[ edit ]
Glen D. Lapp, aged 40 years, [27] was a nurse and executive assistant from Lancaster, Pennsylvania , United States, and a part of Community Mennonite Church of Lancaster. [42] Lapp was a medical volunteer with the IAM and its partner, the Mennonite Central Committee (MCC). [42] He was serving as manager of IAM 's provincial Ophthalmology program, and as an executive assistant for IAM in Afghanistan, [42] and had been in Afghanistan for two years. [43] Lapp was an alumnus of Eastern Mennonite and Johns Hopkins Universities, and had assisted the MCC in the weeks following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita , with regular prior nursing work Lancaster, Supai, Arizona , and New York City. [42]
Tom Little, aged 61 years, [27] was an optometrist from Delmar, New York , United States, and leader of the IAM team. Little had worked in Afghanistan for more than three decades, having arrived in the late 1970s; [44] he had raised three daughters there,[ citation needed ] and spoke Dari fluently. [44] Little was posthumously recognized as International Optometrist of the Year by the World Council of Optometry , [45] and the 2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom . [46]
Dan Terry, aged 64 years, [27] was from Wisconsin, United States, who served as liaison with local communities, aid organizations, and the government; he had performed relief work in Afghanistan since 1971, following in his father's footsteps who had worked for IAM as the Executive Director. [47] [48]
Karen Woo, aged 36 years, [27] daughter of a Chinese father and English mother, [49] was a general surgeon from Stevenage , Hertfordshire, UK, [3] [37] [50] trained at St Mary's Hospital, London and formerly with the English healthcare organisation Bupa . [51] Woo's work involved helping pregnant women, in an area with a high global infant mortality rate. [50] After her death, Woo's family stated that "although very spiritual, she did not really believe in organised religion" and that her motivations were purely humanitarian. [52] [53] Woo was engaged to be married at the time of her death. [2] [50]
The only two survivors of the eye camp team were Said Yasin and Safiullah, both Afghan. Said Yasin had left the team several days earlier and returned to Kabul by another route, [26] whereas Safiullah was spared after reciting verses from the Koran. [54]
The local officials initially stated that the motive was robbery, but after interviewing witnesses they changed their view and said that Taliban was responsible. [2] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahaden claimed responsibility for the attacks and accused the victims of being "American spies" and "proselytizing Christianity". [14] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid stated that the victims had in their possession Bibles which had been translated into the local language Dari . [55] However, also another group was mentioned, the Hizb-i-Islami (HIA) of warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] Earlier claims of the Taliban were refuted by Qari Malang, the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban. He said that commanders from Nuristan had not carried out the killings and they had launched an investigation to find out who had. "We shall inform you of the results when it is concluded. We regret these killings and strongly assert that this is not the work of the Taliban who will never do harm to genuine aid workers… as soon as we manage to apprehend those responsible for this act, we shall subject them to whatever punishment our laws prescribe." [7] Dirk Frans, executive director of the IAM in Kabul, doubted whether the local Taliban were behind the attack, [61] in contrast to a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton which directly blamed the Taliban for what she described as a "despicable act of wanton violence.". In her reaction on 8 August 2010, she stated: "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this senseless act. We also condemn the Taliban’s transparent attempt to justify the unjustifiable by making false accusations about their activities in Afghanistan. Terror has no religion (...), they have shown us yet another example of the lengths to which they will go to advance their twisted ideology." [62] [63]
In the weeks following the attack a senior Taliban leader, Qari Malang (the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban) stated "We have checked the facts regarding these foreigners, and our people in the area have conﬁrmed that they were bona ﬁde aid workers and had been providing assistance to the population. Furthermore, we have learnt that among the killed foreigners, was Dan Terry, who had a long history of helping our people, including in Kunar and Laghman provinces and that he had previously provided welfare assistance to the families of those civilians martyred in bombardments… We pass on our condolences to the families of those killed." [7]
After the massacre, the IAM stated that they had no plans to leave Afghanistan. [64] US Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into the attacks according a spokesman from US embassy. [64] [65]
Former Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah who is a physician himself and trained with Tom Little deplored the killings and called the attackers "enemies of the Afghan people." [66]
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who emphasized that "health workers must have access to treat those in need and must be able to do so without fear." [67] His Special Representative Staffan de Mistura said "The United Nations condemns this serious crime and apparent cold-blooded execution." [68]
Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith issued a statement condemning the attack and offered condolences to the victims' families. [69] British foreign secretary William Hague condemned the attack and stated "This is a deplorable and cowardly act which is against the interests of the people of Afghanistan who depended on the services she [Karen Woo] was bravely helping to provide." [9] United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton condemned the killings, calling them "despicable acts of wanton violence." (see above) [15] Karl Eikenberry , the current United States Ambassador to Afghanistan , speaking to Afghan people said, "Their murder demonstrates the absolute disregard that terrorist-inspired Taliban and other insurgents have for your health, have for your security and have for your opportunity, They don't care about your future. They only care about themselves and their own ideology." [37] US special envoy Richard Holbrooke stated the killers do not represent average Afghans, most of whom were shocked by these killings. [69]

The bodies of the victims were flown back to Kabul on 8 August 2010. [15] The foreigners killed were all unpaid volunteers. [14]
Mahram Ali, aged 51 years, [27] of the Hazara ethnic minority, from Wardak , Afghanistan, was a civilian contractor that had been a worker at the National Organisation for Ophthalmic Rehabilitation ’s (NOOR's) maintenance workshop since 2007; [28] he served as a driver for the expedition, and as "watcher", to guard team vehicles. [28] [29] In this service to IAM , Ali drove and “stayed behind guarding the vehicles in Nawa when the rest of the team walked over the pass into Nuristan.” [28] Ali was described as "the only person to care for his family” by Rahim Majid, the operations manager at IAM. [29] Ali was also survived by a wife and three young children, [28] [29] including one son paralyzed by polio and an another son whose arm had been amputated, all supported on his monthly $150 salary.

Daniela Beyer, aged 35 years, [27] was a linguist and translator in German, English and Russian who also spoke Dari and was learning Pashto; from Chemnitz-Wittgensdorf , Germany. [32] [33]
Brian Carderelli, aged 25 years and from Harrisonburg, Virginia , United States, [27] was a civilian contractor, and a professional freelance videographer who had worked with various Afghan development and humanitarian organizations in Afghanistan. [34] [35] [36] Carderelli had been working for the International School of Kabul , and documenting aid work done by the IAM and other groups. [35] A statement released by his family said that Calderelli "loved people and was particularly concerned for the poor". [35] [36] He was a lifelong member of Covenant Presbyterian Church in Harrisonburg, [35] and a 2009 graduate of James Madison University and was approaching the one year anniversary of his service in Afghanistan. [35] [36] According to his family, “Brian quickly fell in love with the Afghan people and culture and hoped to stay within the country for another year,” [35] and was compiling a photographic and video album entitled "The Beauty – It's Not All War." [35] [36]
Thomas Grams, aged 51 years, [27] of Durango, Colorado , United States, friend of team leader Tom Little, began to work in dentistry for impoverished children about 10 years before his death, via Denver -based agency Global Dental Relief (GDR). [27] [37] One of native twin brothers and dentists from Park Rapids, Minnesota, [38] Grams left their "thriving" private general dentistry practice in Durango in 2007 to join GDR full-time, [27] [37] [39] [40] going first to Nepal ("trekk[ing]... halfway up... Everest, carrying dental equipment by yak" [27] ), [37] and then several times to Afghanistan, initially as a volunteer, later as team leader. [37] [38] [40] Significant Afghanistan efforts included providing free dental care in the village Wardak, "negotiat[ing] the etiquette of the burka" to found a Kabul dental clinic (employing a local female dentist), [27] [39] and participating in English teaching at a local school. [39] "[U]nassuming and modest," Grams was described by the IAM as "one of our favorit[e]" aid workers. [37]
Jawed, known by this single name, aged 24 years, [27] from Panjshir , Afghanistan, was a civilian contractor that had been at the Eye Hospital of the Afghan Ministry of Public Health in Kabul, and was given leave to serve as the team cook at its Eye Camp. [41] This was not his first service with IAM , where he cooked and helped with dispensing eyeglasses; per the IAM, “Jawed had been on several eye camps into Nuristan in the past, and was well loved for his sense of humor,” [41] and was known for providing his collection of music tapes for weddings and parties. [27] The principal breadwinner for his wife, three young children, and extended family, [27] [41] Jawed had been excited about the $20-a-day in overtime that he was earning on the medical outreach trip. [27] Jawed’s brother Abdul Bagin described his killers as "infidels; not human, not Muslims... [killing] without any judgment, without any trial”. [27]
Glen D. Lapp[ edit ]
Glen D. Lapp, aged 40 years, [27] was a nurse and executive assistant from Lancaster, Pennsylvania , United States, and a part of Community Mennonite Church of Lancaster. [42] Lapp was a medical volunteer with the IAM and its partner, the Mennonite Central Committee (MCC). [42] He was serving as manager of IAM 's provincial Ophthalmology program, and as an executive assistant for IAM in Afghanistan, [42] and had been in Afghanistan for two years. [43] Lapp was an alumnus of Eastern Mennonite and Johns Hopkins Universities, and had assisted the MCC in the weeks following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita , with regular prior nursing work Lancaster, Supai, Arizona , and New York City. [42]
Tom Little, aged 61 years, [27] was an optometrist from Delmar, New York , United States, and leader of the IAM team. Little had worked in Afghanistan for more than three decades, having arrived in the late 1970s; [44] he had raised three daughters there,[ citation needed ] and spoke Dari fluently. [44] Little was posthumously recognized as International Optometrist of the Year by the World Council of Optometry , [45] and the 2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom . [46]
Dan Terry, aged 64 years, [27] was from Wisconsin, United States, who served as liaison with local communities, aid organizations, and the government; he had performed relief work in Afghanistan since 1971, following in his father's footsteps who had worked for IAM as the Executive Director. [47] [48]
Karen Woo, aged 36 years, [27] daughter of a Chinese father and English mother, [49] was a general surgeon from Stevenage , Hertfordshire, UK, [3] [37] [50] trained at St Mary's Hospital, London and formerly with the English healthcare organisation Bupa . [51] Woo's work involved helping pregnant women, in an area with a high global infant mortality rate. [50] After her death, Woo's family stated that "although very spiritual, she did not really believe in organised religion" and that her motivations were purely humanitarian. [52] [53] Woo was engaged to be married at the time of her death. [2] [50]
The only two survivors of the eye camp team were Said Yasin and Safiullah, both Afghan. Said Yasin had left the team several days earlier and returned to Kabul by another route, [26] whereas Safiullah was spared after reciting verses from the Koran. [54]
The local officials initially stated that the motive was robbery, but after interviewing witnesses they changed their view and said that Taliban was responsible. [2] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahaden claimed responsibility for the attacks and accused the victims of being "American spies" and "proselytizing Christianity". [14] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid stated that the victims had in their possession Bibles which had been translated into the local language Dari . [55] However, also another group was mentioned, the Hizb-i-Islami (HIA) of warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] Earlier claims of the Taliban were refuted by Qari Malang, the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban. He said that commanders from Nuristan had not carried out the killings and they had launched an investigation to find out who had. "We shall inform you of the results when it is concluded. We regret these killings and strongly assert that this is not the work of the Taliban who will never do harm to genuine aid workers… as soon as we manage to apprehend those responsible for this act, we shall subject them to whatever punishment our laws prescribe." [7] Dirk Frans, executive director of the IAM in Kabul, doubted whether the local Taliban were behind the attack, [61] in contrast to a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton which directly blamed the Taliban for what she described as a "despicable act of wanton violence.". In her reaction on 8 August 2010, she stated: "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this senseless act. We also condemn the Taliban’s transparent attempt to justify the unjustifiable by making false accusations about their activities in Afghanistan. Terror has no religion (...), they have shown us yet another example of the lengths to which they will go to advance their twisted ideology." [62] [63]
In the weeks following the attack a senior Taliban leader, Qari Malang (the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban) stated "We have checked the facts regarding these foreigners, and our people in the area have conﬁrmed that they were bona ﬁde aid workers and had been providing assistance to the population. Furthermore, we have learnt that among the killed foreigners, was Dan Terry, who had a long history of helping our people, including in Kunar and Laghman provinces and that he had previously provided welfare assistance to the families of those civilians martyred in bombardments… We pass on our condolences to the families of those killed." [7]
After the massacre, the IAM stated that they had no plans to leave Afghanistan. [64] US Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into the attacks according a spokesman from US embassy. [64] [65]
Former Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah who is a physician himself and trained with Tom Little deplored the killings and called the attackers "enemies of the Afghan people." [66]
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who emphasized that "health workers must have access to treat those in need and must be able to do so without fear." [67] His Special Representative Staffan de Mistura said "The United Nations condemns this serious crime and apparent cold-blooded execution." [68]
Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith issued a statement condemning the attack and offered condolences to the victims' families. [69] British foreign secretary William Hague condemned the attack and stated "This is a deplorable and cowardly act which is against the interests of the people of Afghanistan who depended on the services she [Karen Woo] was bravely helping to provide." [9] United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton condemned the killings, calling them "despicable acts of wanton violence." (see above) [15] Karl Eikenberry , the current United States Ambassador to Afghanistan , speaking to Afghan people said, "Their murder demonstrates the absolute disregard that terrorist-inspired Taliban and other insurgents have for your health, have for your security and have for your opportunity, They don't care about your future. They only care about themselves and their own ideology." [37] US special envoy Richard Holbrooke stated the killers do not represent average Afghans, most of whom were shocked by these killings. [69]

Should this be called a 'massacre'? I agree it was dreadful, but NPOV applies: if ten Afghanis had been killed, would it have been called a 'massacre'? Aa42john ( talk ) —Preceding undated comment added 13:29, 8 August 2010 (UTC).
Came here solely to point that out. Should be renamed to "2010 Badakhshan incident". It's not necessarily a POV to claim it was a massacre, however; I believe there is a threshold for what is deemed what. Eric

Some of the RS are calling it a 'massacre'. [1] and yes if 10 afghan , unarmed civilian aid workers had been lined up and shot in cold blood it should be called a massacre. 2 of the victims were Afghan. any thresholds anybody has would necessarily be arbitrary.see Munich massacre for example and precedent.-- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 14:34, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
I also find "massacre" to be rather provocatively POV, as well as inaccurate and support changing the title to "2010 Badakhshan incident". Doc Tropics 17:11, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
I feel that "massacre" is the correct terminology in this instance. Massacre is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as "the indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people", which seems to accurately describe what took place, regardless of political perspective. The problem with "incident" is that the term implies a relative insignificant occurrence, and could be perceived as minimising the importance of what took place. City of Destruction 18:01, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
NATO kills civilians accidently not on purpose, but these guys killed on purpose.. And you are accually POV. NATO is not there to kill civilians.. Is it difficult to understand? In which world do you live? But I understand you because your holy book Quran says :"Muslims and Christians can not be friend." —Preceding unsigned comment added by 217.131.183.218 ( talk ) 19:40, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
Doesnt seem to be indiscriminate ("2.Random; haphazard") if the Taliban explicitly said why it was a target. Why not call the Iraq and Afghan wars massacres then? Lihaas ( talk ) 20:31, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
does look haphazard/ indiscriminate. why kill 2 Afghans if motive was to kill proselytizing Christians. Besides New York Times [2] describes it as a massacre.-- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 21:22, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
Well you're asking the Taliban to be logical by demanding why they killed two of their own in addition to killing 8 Christians; the fact that they're justifying 9/11, attempting to kill or maim fleeing women ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1299799/Mutilated-Taliban-The-girl-18-nose-ears-hacked-trying-flee-cruel-laws.html ) and so forth means we can expect at least a little illogic on their part. But just a little! Furthermore, it's been made very explicit by the Taliban, such as this recent release: ( http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2010/07/mullah_omar_orders_t.php ) that the Taliban consider any collaborating Afghani to be a traitor. And Islam demands the death of Apostates (Qur'an (4:89)) (Qur'an (9:11-12)) So to answer all of your politically correct attempts to cover up the Islamic and discriminatory nature of the attack, here is my final piece of evidence:
Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said bibles translated into Dari had been found. "Yesterday at around 0800 (0330 GMT), one of our patrols confronted a group of foreigners. They were Christian missionaries and we killed them all," he told the AFP news agency.

68.42.250.113 ( talk ) 22:20, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
And on another point, the Iraq war and the Afghan wars are not called massacres, because equating the military performance of the US (where at least soldiers have orders not to harm civilians as the rules of war dictate) with the performance of the Taliban, who as I have already shown above, are not above killing women for fleeing their husbands or offering medical aid is ridiculous. 68.42.250.113 ( talk ) 22:38, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
If you want to use that logic, then i suppose raping and killing girls (that doesnt include women, or even premeditated murder of men) is the mandate of the usa govt/military too as per the Rules of war ? Lihaas ( talk ) 22:45, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
No because those aren't the actions of US soldiers or by any within the rules of war. You're not referring to any logic I have used there buddy. The US army does not rape anyone. It also has orders not to kill civilians. A massacre and a war are two different things, that was the only logic implied. 68.42.250.113 ( talk ) 00:52, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
A specific mass killing of civilians by US forces, such as the My Lai Massacre , can be described as a massacre. A conflict in which the US is involved, including Vietnam and Afghanistan, cannot. City of Destruction 15:55, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
Because one of them is a war, and the other is a specific event in war that is against the rules of war. 68.42.250.113 ( talk ) 16:32, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
She is becoming the focus of separate and extensive attention. I think based on other articles, she should get her own page. Proven81 ( talk ) 15:44, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
I agree.-- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 16:31, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
She is getting far, far more coverage than anyone else. Maybe it's her looks. Paris Hilton gets far more coverage than her acting career would suggest and Anna Chapman got far more coverage than the other Russian spies. Suomi Finland 2009 ( talk ) 18:43, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
or maybe the fact she is a young woman surgeon who gave up a lucrative career to work for the poor in a dangerous country and was to marry in 2 weeks. regardless of the reason she is getting a lot of coverage in the RS's and would merit her own article.-- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 21:26, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
An admirable person certainly. Not so sure she is notable enough for her own article. At least a re-direct from Karen Woo to this article seems a good idea. (Done I see! & Tom Little ) Same for the other named persons involved too? Glen D. Lapp , Thomas Grams ? 220.101 talk \Contribs 03:49, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
Should every piece of news really be turned into an encyclopedia article? The word massacre as was stated before: "the indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people." It wasn't indiscriminate from the accounts of what happened that appear in the news. FYI: indiscriminate: Done at random or without careful judgment
The reaction section is just there for emotional effect. Remember to include reaction statements from the belligerents. Unless you enjoy bias.
—Preceding unsigned comment added by 76.113.192.38 ( talk ) 18:45, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
Ditto, and Said the same above.
Also need a "responsibility" section for why Talib did so and their claim thereof,. Lihaas ( talk ) 20:34, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
The statement from Taliban spokesman was part of the article from the beginning. i doubt very much that we will get many statements sympathetic to the Taliban here. but if we do they should be included as long as they come from prominent sources. -- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 21:37, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
If he does not get his own page (along with each of the victims) should this link to pictures of one of his eye camps be added to the end? http://globalphotographer.wordpress.com/afghanistan/afghanistan-2004/noor-eye-project/ Proepro ( talk ) —Preceding undated comment added 12:47, 9 August 2010 (UTC).
Be bold! 220.101 talk \Contribs 20:01, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
Info on all 10 killed:
the "Victoms" section and documentation of each victim is completely memorialising and does not further this article. The list at the top of the 10 victims is brief and notable to this, but the lifestory of some such as "engaged to be married in two weeks" is complete nonsense for an encyclopaedia Lihaas ( talk ) 23:39, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
nothing is nonsense here. People reading about this incident would be interested in some detail about the victims and this info is very useful. especially so if we are not going to have separate articles for the victim especially Woo. The RS's are replete with details of her life. if we do end up having separate articles for the victims then maybe we can move some info there. Till then we need to add further detail about the victims and expand the section. this is all very encyclopedic info which definitely belongs.-- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 00:21, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
Lets just keep in mind Encyclopaedia , RECENTISM and NOTNEWS . The article looks alright. After the furor dies down, investigations are made and the facts (hopefully) come out, then culling of some details may be in order, IMHO. Regards, 220.101 talk \Contribs 03:00, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
This article or section is written like a memorial. Please help rewrite it from a neutral point of view to establish the notability of the subject.
NPOV? Are you kidding me? From who's point of view? The benefiting Grim Reaper or the Taliban's? 68.42.250.113 ( talk ) 17:59, 11 August 2010 (UTC)
Update of the killing[ edit ]
[Hamid Karzai] statement?[ edit ]
Does anyone have a statement from Karzai about this? Proepro ( talk ) 17:03, 21 August 2010 (UTC)

No because those aren't the actions of US soldiers or by any within the rules of war. You're not referring to any logic I have used there buddy. The US army does not rape anyone. It also has orders not to kill civilians. A massacre and a war are two different things, that was the only logic implied. 68.42.250.113 ( talk ) 00:52, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
A specific mass killing of civilians by US forces, such as the My Lai Massacre , can be described as a massacre. A conflict in which the US is involved, including Vietnam and Afghanistan, cannot. City of Destruction 15:55, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
Because one of them is a war, and the other is a specific event in war that is against the rules of war. 68.42.250.113 ( talk ) 16:32, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
She is becoming the focus of separate and extensive attention. I think based on other articles, she should get her own page. Proven81 ( talk ) 15:44, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
I agree.-- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 16:31, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
She is getting far, far more coverage than anyone else. Maybe it's her looks. Paris Hilton gets far more coverage than her acting career would suggest and Anna Chapman got far more coverage than the other Russian spies. Suomi Finland 2009 ( talk ) 18:43, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
or maybe the fact she is a young woman surgeon who gave up a lucrative career to work for the poor in a dangerous country and was to marry in 2 weeks. regardless of the reason she is getting a lot of coverage in the RS's and would merit her own article.-- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 21:26, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
An admirable person certainly. Not so sure she is notable enough for her own article. At least a re-direct from Karen Woo to this article seems a good idea. (Done I see! & Tom Little ) Same for the other named persons involved too? Glen D. Lapp , Thomas Grams ? 220.101 talk \Contribs 03:49, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
Should every piece of news really be turned into an encyclopedia article? The word massacre as was stated before: "the indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people." It wasn't indiscriminate from the accounts of what happened that appear in the news. FYI: indiscriminate: Done at random or without careful judgment
The reaction section is just there for emotional effect. Remember to include reaction statements from the belligerents. Unless you enjoy bias.

Ditto, and Said the same above.
Also need a "responsibility" section for why Talib did so and their claim thereof,. Lihaas ( talk ) 20:34, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
The statement from Taliban spokesman was part of the article from the beginning. i doubt very much that we will get many statements sympathetic to the Taliban here. but if we do they should be included as long as they come from prominent sources. -- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 21:37, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
If he does not get his own page (along with each of the victims) should this link to pictures of one of his eye camps be added to the end? http://globalphotographer.wordpress.com/afghanistan/afghanistan-2004/noor-eye-project/ Proepro ( talk ) —Preceding undated comment added 12:47, 9 August 2010 (UTC).
Be bold! 220.101 talk \Contribs 20:01, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
Info on all 10 killed:
the "Victoms" section and documentation of each victim is completely memorialising and does not further this article. The list at the top of the 10 victims is brief and notable to this, but the lifestory of some such as "engaged to be married in two weeks" is complete nonsense for an encyclopaedia Lihaas ( talk ) 23:39, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
nothing is nonsense here. People reading about this incident would be interested in some detail about the victims and this info is very useful. especially so if we are not going to have separate articles for the victim especially Woo. The RS's are replete with details of her life. if we do end up having separate articles for the victims then maybe we can move some info there. Till then we need to add further detail about the victims and expand the section. this is all very encyclopedic info which definitely belongs.-- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 00:21, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
Lets just keep in mind Encyclopaedia , RECENTISM and NOTNEWS . The article looks alright. After the furor dies down, investigations are made and the facts (hopefully) come out, then culling of some details may be in order, IMHO. Regards, 220.101 talk \Contribs 03:00, 10 August 2010 (UTC)

2010 Badakhshan massacre - WOW.com Search the Web. Search ... Unknown
On 5 August 2010, ten members of International Assistance Mission (IAM) Nuristan Eye Camp team were killed in Kuran wa Munjan District of Badakhshan Province in Afghanistan. [1] [2] The team was attacked as it was returning from Nuristan to Kabul. One team member was spared, the rest of the team were killed immediately. Those killed were six Americans, two Afghans, one Briton and one German. [3]
The identity of the attackers is unknown. When news of the killings broke, both Hizb-e Islami and the Taliban initially claimed responsibility for the attack, [2] accusing the doctors of proselytism and spying. [4] [5] [6] These claims were later refuted by Taliban leaders in Nuristan and Badakhshan, who stated that they had confirmed the dead were bona-fide aid workers, condemned the killings as murder, and offered their condolences to the families of those killed. [7]
The attack was the deadliest strike against foreign aid workers in the Afghanistan war . [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The killings underscored the suspicion Christian-affiliated groups face from some Afghans and government opponents and the wider risks faced by aid workers in the country. [13]
Contents
Background and context
Badakhshan province borders Tajikistan and is inhabited by mostly Tajik people . It is one of the few provinces in Afghanistan which was not controlled by the Taliban when it was in power. [14] After coming under increasing pressure by NATO forces in southern Afghanistan the Taliban have become active in areas like Badakhshan Province which were previously calm. In addition they have started using women and children as suicide bombers and targeted tribal elders, things they formerly considered taboo. [2] Foreign aid workers have been attacked in the past but these attacks have been relatively infrequent and Taliban has allowed some aid workers in the areas they controlled. [9] Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission stated that civilian deaths were up five percent in 2010 and Taliban was responsible for 68% of the 1325 deaths till 8 August 2010 and NATO was responsible for 28%. [15] IAM is a Christian organization that has worked in Afghanistan since 1966. They have denied proselytizing , [16] as for non-Muslims it is against the law of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. According to critics propagandists of the Taliban insurgency portray their drive for power as a defense of Islam. The victims of the massacre had indeed been sponsored by a Christian charity, but that organization worked in Afghanistan since 1966, under a monarchy, a communist regime, warlords, and under the Taliban; its aid workers were said to understand the Afghan customs and sensibilities and have scrupulously obeyed prohibitions against proselytizing. [17] None of the Christian non-profit's workers had ever been killed while on duty with the organisation. [18]
The publicity on the massacre and its aftermath coincided with the publication of the 2010 Mid-Year Report on Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), [19] [20] [21] in which worries were expressed about the rising number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan and that was directly followed by an advice of human rights organisation Amnesty International that the Taliban should be prosecuted for war crimes . [22] According to the UNAMA report, the tactics of the Taliban and other Anti-Government Elements (AGEs) were behind a 31 per cent increase in conflict-related civilian casualties in the first six months of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Casualties attributed to Pro-Government Forces (PGF) fell 30 per cent during the same period, driven by a 64 per cent decline in deaths and injuries caused by aerial attacks. Many Afghans blame the international forces for the civilian deaths, "stirring up greater violence by fomenting new recruits for the Taliban, for arming militias in the countryside, and for propping up warlords and corrupt Afghan officials". [23] [24] [25]
Ambush
The team, which included a doctor, a dentist and an optometrist, was returning to Kabul after providing eye care to villagers in Parun valley in Nuristan Province , south of Badakhshan Province in Northeast Afghanistan. [11] They had been running an eye camp in Nuristan, for which they had received permission from the Afghan government. They had chosen to travel through a forest in Badakhshan as this was considered a safer route back to Kabul. The team was attacked when they stopped after fording a river. They were killed immediately, without any negotiation. One Afghan driver was spared after he started chanting verses from the Qur'an . [2] When the bodies were recovered, the victims appeared to have been robbed. [14] The two Afghans killed worked as a watchman and a cook. The bodies of the victims were flown back to Kabul on 8 August 2010. [15] The foreigners killed were all unpaid volunteers. [14]

[41] This was not his first service with IAM , where he cooked and helped with dispensing eyeglasses; per the IAM, “Jawed had been on several eye camps into Nuristan in the past, and was well loved for his sense of humor,” [41] and was known for providing his collection of music tapes for weddings and parties. [27] The principal breadwinner for his wife, three young children, and extended family, [27] [41] Jawed had been excited about the $20-a-day in overtime that he was earning on the medical outreach trip. [27] Jawed’s brother Abdul Bagin described his killers as "infidels; not human, not Muslims... [killing] without any judgment, without any trial”. [27]

[52] [53] Woo was engaged to be married at the time of her death. [2] [50]
Survivors
The only two survivors of the eye camp team were Said Yasin and Safiullah, both Afghan. Said Yasin had left the team several days earlier and returned to Kabul by another route, [26] whereas Safiullah was spared after reciting verses from the Koran. [54]
Responsibility
The local officials initially stated that the motive was robbery, but after interviewing witnesses they changed their view and said that Taliban was responsible. [2] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahaden claimed responsibility for the attacks and accused the victims of being "American spies" and "proselytizing Christianity". [14] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid stated that the victims had in their possession Bibles which had been translated into the local language Dari . [55] However, also another group was mentioned, the Hizb-i-Islami (HIA) of warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] Earlier claims of the Taliban were refuted by Qari Malang, the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban. He said that commanders from Nuristan had not carried out the killings and they had launched an investigation to find out who had. "We shall inform you of the results when it is concluded. We regret these killings and strongly assert that this is not the work of the Taliban who will never do harm to genuine aid workers… as soon as we manage to apprehend those responsible for this act, we shall subject them to whatever punishment our laws prescribe." [7] Dirk Frans, executive director of the IAM in Kabul, doubted whether the local Taliban were behind the attack, [61] in contrast to a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton which directly blamed the Taliban for what she described as a "despicable act of wanton violence.". In her reaction on 8 August 2010, she stated: "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this senseless act. We also condemn the Taliban’s transparent attempt to justify the unjustifiable by making false accusations about their activities in Afghanistan. Terror has no religion (...), they have shown us yet another example of the lengths to which they will go to advance their twisted ideology." [62] [63]
Reactions
In the weeks following the attack a senior Taliban leader, Qari Malang (the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban) stated "We have checked the facts regarding these foreigners, and our people in the area have conﬁrmed that they were bona ﬁde aid workers and had been providing assistance to the population. Furthermore, we have learnt that among the killed foreigners, was Dan Terry, who had a long history of helping our people, including in Kunar and Laghman provinces and that he had previously provided welfare assistance to the families of those civilians martyred in bombardments… We pass on our condolences to the families of those killed." [7]
After the massacre, the IAM stated that they had no plans to leave Afghanistan. [64] US Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into the attacks according a spokesman from US embassy. [64] [65]
Former Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah who is a physician himself and trained with Tom Little deplored the killings and called the attackers "enemies of the Afghan people." [66]
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who emphasized that "health workers must have access to treat those in need and must be able to do so without fear." [67] His Special Representative Staffan de Mistura said "The United Nations condemns this serious crime and apparent cold-blooded execution." [68]
Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith issued a statement condemning the attack and offered condolences to the victims' families. [69] British foreign secretary William Hague condemned the attack and stated "This is a deplorable and cowardly act which is against the interests of the people of Afghanistan who depended on the services she [Karen Woo] was bravely helping to provide." [9] United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton condemned the killings, calling them "despicable acts of wanton violence." (see above) [15] Karl Eikenberry , the current United States Ambassador to Afghanistan , speaking to Afghan people said, "Their murder demonstrates the absolute disregard that terrorist-inspired Taliban and other insurgents have for your health, have for your security and have for your opportunity, They don't care about your future. They only care about themselves and their own ideology." [37] US special envoy Richard Holbrooke stated the killers do not represent average Afghans, most of whom were shocked by these killings. [69]

[37] [38] [40] Significant Afghanistan efforts included providing free dental care in the village Wardak, "negotiat[ing] the etiquette of the burka" to found a Kabul dental clinic (employing a local female dentist), [27] [39] and participating in English teaching at a local school. [39] "[U]nassuming and modest," Grams was described by the IAM as "one of our favorit[e]" aid workers. [37]

[41] This was not his first service with IAM , where he cooked and helped with dispensing eyeglasses; per the IAM, “Jawed had been on several eye camps into Nuristan in the past, and was well loved for his sense of humor,” [41] and was known for providing his collection of music tapes for weddings and parties. [27] The principal breadwinner for his wife, three young children, and extended family, [27] [41] Jawed had been excited about the $20-a-day in overtime that he was earning on the medical outreach trip. [27] Jawed’s brother Abdul Bagin described his killers as "infidels; not human, not Muslims... [killing] without any judgment, without any trial”. [27]
Glen D. Lapp
Glen D. Lapp, aged 40 years, [27] was a nurse and executive assistant from Lancaster, Pennsylvania , United States, and a part of Community Mennonite Church of Lancaster.

[42] He was serving as manager of IAM 's provincial Ophthalmology program, and as an executive assistant for IAM in Afghanistan, [42] and had been in Afghanistan for two years. [43] Lapp was an alumnus of Eastern Mennonite and Johns Hopkins Universities, and had assisted the MCC in the weeks following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita , with regular prior nursing work Lancaster, Supai, Arizona , and New York City. [42]

[50] After her death, Woo's family stated that "although very spiritual, she did not really believe in organised religion" and that her motivations were purely humanitarian. [52] [53] Woo was engaged to be married at the time of her death. [2] [50]
Survivors
The only two survivors of the eye camp team were Said Yasin and Safiullah, both Afghan. Said Yasin had left the team several days earlier and returned to Kabul by another route, [26] whereas Safiullah was spared after reciting verses from the Koran. [54]
Responsibility
The local officials initially stated that the motive was robbery, but after interviewing witnesses they changed their view and said that Taliban was responsible. [2] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahaden claimed responsibility for the attacks and accused the victims of being "American spies" and "proselytizing Christianity". [14] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid stated that the victims had in their possession Bibles which had been translated into the local language Dari . [55] However, also another group was mentioned, the Hizb-i-Islami (HIA) of warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] Earlier claims of the Taliban were refuted by Qari Malang, the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban. He said that commanders from Nuristan had not carried out the killings and they had launched an investigation to find out who had. "We shall inform you of the results when it is concluded. We regret these killings and strongly assert that this is not the work of the Taliban who will never do harm to genuine aid workers… as soon as we manage to apprehend those responsible for this act, we shall subject them to whatever punishment our laws prescribe." [7] Dirk Frans, executive director of the IAM in Kabul, doubted whether the local Taliban were behind the attack, [61] in contrast to a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton which directly blamed the Taliban for what she described as a "despicable act of wanton violence.". In her reaction on 8 August 2010, she stated: "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this senseless act. We also condemn the Taliban’s transparent attempt to justify the unjustifiable by making false accusations about their activities in Afghanistan. Terror has no religion (...), they have shown us yet another example of the lengths to which they will go to advance their twisted ideology." [62] [63]
Reactions
In the weeks following the attack a senior Taliban leader, Qari Malang (the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban) stated "We have checked the facts regarding these foreigners, and our people in the area have conﬁrmed that they were bona ﬁde aid workers and had been providing assistance to the population. Furthermore, we have learnt that among the killed foreigners, was Dan Terry, who had a long history of helping our people, including in Kunar and Laghman provinces and that he had previously provided welfare assistance to the families of those civilians martyred in bombardments… We pass on our condolences to the families of those killed." [7]
After the massacre, the IAM stated that they had no plans to leave Afghanistan. [64] US Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into the attacks according a spokesman from US embassy. [64] [65]
Former Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah who is a physician himself and trained with Tom Little deplored the killings and called the attackers "enemies of the Afghan people." [66]
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who emphasized that "health workers must have access to treat those in need and must be able to do so without fear." [67] His Special Representative Staffan de Mistura said "The United Nations condemns this serious crime and apparent cold-blooded execution." [68]
Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith issued a statement condemning the attack and offered condolences to the victims' families. [69] British foreign secretary William Hague condemned the attack and stated "This is a deplorable and cowardly act which is against the interests of the people of Afghanistan who depended on the services she [Karen Woo] was bravely helping to provide." [9] United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton condemned the killings, calling them "despicable acts of wanton violence." (see above) [15] Karl Eikenberry , the current United States Ambassador to Afghanistan , speaking to Afghan people said, "Their murder demonstrates the absolute disregard that terrorist-inspired Taliban and other insurgents have for your health, have for your security and have for your opportunity, They don't care about your future. They only care about themselves and their own ideology." [37] US special envoy Richard Holbrooke stated the killers do not represent average Afghans, most of whom were shocked by these killings. [69]

On August 5, 2010, ten members of International Assistance Mission Nuristan Eye Camp team were killed in Kuran wa Munjan District of Badakhshan Province in Afghanistan . [1] [2] The team was attacked as it was returning from Nuristan to Kabul. One team member was spared, the rest of the team were killed immediately. Those killed were six Americans, two Afghans, one Briton and one German. [3]
The identity of the attackers is unknown. When news of the killings broke, both Hizb-e Islami and the Taliban initially claimed responsibility for the attack, [2] accusing the doctors of proselytism and spying. [4] [5] [6] These claims were later refuted by Taliban leaders in Nuristan and Badakhshan, who stated that they had confirmed the dead were bona-fide aid workers, condemned the killings as murder, and offered their condolences to the families of those killed. [7]
The attack was the deadliest strike against foreign aid workers in the Afghanistan war . [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The killings underscored the suspicion Christian-affiliated groups face from some Afghans and government opponents and the wider risks faced by aid workers in the country. [13]

Badakhshan province borders Tajikistan and is inhabited by mostly Tajik people . It is one of the few provinces in Afghanistan which was not controlled by the Taliban when it was in power. [14] After coming under increasing pressure by NATO forces in southern Afghanistan the Taliban have become active in areas like Badakhshan Province which were previously calm. In addition they have started using women and children as suicide bombers and targeted tribal elders, things they formerly considered taboo. [2] Foreign aid workers have been attacked in the past but these attacks have been relatively infrequent and Taliban has allowed some aid workers in the areas they controlled. [9] Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission stated that civilian deaths were up five percent in 2010 and Taliban was responsible for 68% of the 1325 deaths till August 8, 2010 and NATO was responsible for 28%. [15] International Assistance Mission is a Christian organization that has worked in Afghanistan since 1966. They have denied proselytizing , [16] as for non-Muslims it is against the law of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. According to critics propagandists of the Taliban insurgency portray their drive for power as a defense of Islam. The victims of the massacre had indeed been sponsored by a Christian charity, but that organization worked in Afghanistan since 1966, under a monarchy, a communist regime, warlords, and under the Taliban; its aid workers were said to understand the Afghan customs and sensibilities and have scrupulously obeyed prohibitions against proselytizing. [17] None of the Christian non-profit's workers had ever been killed while on duty with the organisation. [18]
The publicity on the massacre and its aftermath coincided with the publication of the 2010 Mid-Year Report on Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), [19] [20] [21] in which worries were expressed about the rising number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan and that was directly followed by an advice of human rights organisation Amnesty International that the Taliban should be prosecuted for war crimes . [22] According to the UNAMA report, the tactics of the Taliban and other Anti-Government Elements (AGEs) were behind a 31 per cent increase in conflict-related civilian casualties in the first six months of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Casualties attributed to Pro-Government Forces (PGF) fell 30 per cent during the same period, driven by a 64 per cent decline in deaths and injuries caused by aerial attacks. Many Afghans blame the international forces for the civilian deaths, "stirring up greater violence by fomenting new recruits for the Taliban, for arming militias in the countryside, and for propping up warlords and corrupt Afghan officials". [23] [24] [25]
Ambush
The team, which included a doctor, a dentist and an optometrist, was returning to Kabul after providing eye care to villagers in Parun valley in Nuristan Province , south of Badakhshan Province in Northeast Afghanistan. [11] They had been running an eye camp in Nuristan, for which they had received permission from the Afghan government. They had chosen to travel through a forest in Badakhshan as this was considered a safer route back to Kabul. The team was attacked when they stopped after fording a river. They were killed immediately, without any negotiation. One Afghan driver was spared after he started chanting verses from the Qur'an. [2] When the bodies were recovered, the victims appeared to have been robbed. [14] The two Afghans killed worked as a watchman and a cook. The bodies of the victims were flown back to Kabul on August 8, 2010. [15] The foreigners killed were all unpaid volunteers. [14]

He said that commanders from Nuristan had not carried out the killings and they had launched an investigation to find out who had. “We shall inform you of the results when it is concluded. We regret these killings and strongly assert that this is not the work of the Taliban who will never do harm to genuine aid workers… as soon as we manage to apprehend those responsible for this act, we shall subject them to whatever punishment our laws prescribe.” [7] Dirk Frans, executive director of the International Assistance Mission (IAM) in Kabul, doubted whether the local Taliban were behind the attack, [54] in contrast to a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton which directly blamed the Taliban for what she described as a "despicable act of wanton violence.". In her reaction on August 8, 2010, she stated: "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this senseless act. We also condemn the Taliban’s transparent attempt to justify the unjustifiable by making false accusations about their activities in Afghanistan. Terror has no religion (...), they have shown us yet another example of the lengths to which they will go to advance their twisted ideology." [55] [56]
Reactions
In the weeks following the attack a senior Taliban leader, Qari Malang (the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban) stated “We have checked the facts regarding these foreigners, and our people in the area have conﬁrmed that they were bona ﬁde aid workers and had been providing assistance to the population. Furthermore, we have learnt that among the killed foreigners, was Dan Terry, who had a long history of helping our people, including in Kunar and Laghman provinces and that he had previously provided welfare assistance to the families of those civilians martyred in bombardments… We pass on our condolences to the families of those killed.” [7]
After the massacre International Assistance Mission stated that they had no plans to leave Afghanistan. [57] US Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into the attacks according a spokesman from US embassy. [57] [58]
Former Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah who is a physician himself and trained with Tom Little deplored the killings and called the attackers "enemies of the Afghan people." [59]
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who emphasized that “health workers must have access to treat those in need and must be able to do so without fear.” [60] His Special Representative Staffan de Mistura said "The United Nations condemns this serious crime and apparent cold-blooded execution." [61]
Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith issued a statement condemning the attack and offered condolences to the victims' families. [62] British foreign secretary William Hague condemned the attack and stated "This is a deplorable and cowardly act which is against the interests of the people of Afghanistan who depended on the services she [Karen Woo] was bravely helping to provide." [9] United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton condemned the killings, calling them "despicable acts of wanton violence." (see above) [15] Karl Eikenberry , the current United States Ambassador to Afghanistan , speaking to Afghan people said, "Their murder demonstrates the absolute disregard that terrorist-inspired Taliban and other insurgents have for your health, have for your security and have for your opportunity, They don't care about your future. They only care about themselves and their own ideology." [34] US special envoy Richard Holbrooke stated the killers do not represent average Afghans, most of whom were shocked by these killings. [62]

2011 Fuzhou, Jiangxi bombings - Wikipedia, the free ... The 2011 Fuzhou bombings were three separate, synchronized explosions at government buildings in Fuzhou, Jiangxi, China on the morning of 26 May 2011. At least three ... 2011 Fuzhou bombings
Qian Mingqi (钱明奇; Pinyin : Qián Míngqí)
The 2011 Fuzhou bombings ( Simplified Chinese : 抚州市连环爆炸案; Pinyin : Fǔzhōu shì liánhuán bàozhà àn) were three separate, synchronized explosions at government buildings in Fuzhou, Jiangxi , China on the morning of 26 May 2011. At least three people died, and at least seven were injured. [1] The perpetrator, 52-year-old Qian Mingqi, was initially reported possibly among those killed in the blasts, [2] leading China's state run news agencies to label it a suicide bombing . [3] The Jiangxi Provincial Public Security Department later confirmed that the suspect died at the scene . [4]
The three explosions occurred between 9:18 and 9:45am CST (0100 UTC). [5] The first blast occurred in a parking lot outside the offices of the city prosecutor, the second inside a district administration office, and the third explosion hit the city's food and drug agency. [5] Two of the bombs were placed inside cars parked just outside of the buildings. [6] The official Xinhua news agency had posted a news article on its website saying the bombs were planted by a disgruntled farmer who was dissatisfied with the outcome of a court case , [7] but by 1pm on the day of the bombing the article had been removed from the site . [7]
Contents
In 1995 Qian Mingqi's home was demolished by government authorities to make way for a highway. He then saved up enough money to build a second home, which was also shattered by a second forced demolition. His second house cost about 500,000 yuan , and the authorities paid him only half of that for compensation. [8] Because of the lack of compensation, he posted slogans to resist the demolition. According to his neighbors, Qian's wife was then hung upside down by the demolition team. She died a few years later from gall bladder disease. From the police report of the Fuzhou Police, Qian's wife has been dead for several years. [9]
After the ordeal he then discovered the land seized from him to make a highway was actually not used. [8] By 2002 Qian began petitioning in Fuzhou and Beijing's government offices. Unable to find redress, he reportedly taught himself to use the internet, and cultivate a presence on various blogging platforms, hoping to get the attention of human rights defenders, academics, lawyers, reporters, and police. Not only did Qian fail to elicit the attention of anyone who might help him, but he became aware of other individuals who had similarly had their homes demolished. [10] In one of his blog he accused Linchuan district party cadre of embezzling 10 million yuan in compensation funds after demolishing his house and that of seven other families. [8] Qian had two sons and one daughter. [11]
Bombings, especially ones of this sophistication, are rare in China, [5] but this was the second in a month. Earlier in May 2011 in north-west Gansu province a " petrol bomb " was set off outside a bank by a former employee. [5] There are very few ways for the Chinese people to redress or raise awareness of what they see as a wrong they have suffered, and therefore, as the BBC 's Michael Bristow states, "some Chinese people occasionally take out their frustration in attacks like this." [5]
According to Mingqi's Sina Weibo site and the 2002 demolitions, Qian was fed up. The weibo posts state "Ten years of seeking redress resulted in nothing," [7] and "I was forced to step onto a road I didn't want to step on due to the loss of my newly built house, which was illegally demolished...my total loss was near to RMB two million Yuan." [12] [13] who wrote on Sina.com 's weibo ( microblogging ) service, Sina Weibo , that his home had been demolished illegally. [14] He wrote the last statement in his weibo: "I want to learn from Dong Cunrui [a People's Liberation Army soldier who carried an explosive package and blew up a bunker in 1948] and I hope I can receive the public's support and attention." [15]
The bombs were detonated by Qian Mingqi, aged 52 at the time, who was killed in the explosions. [7] Two victims are security guards of the Linchuan district government building, Xu Yingfu and He Haigen. [16]
"The first bomb, in a vehicle parked inside the gate of the local prosecutor's office, went off at about 9:15 a.m., according to local media reports. A second bomb detonated at 9:30 a.m. at a district government office, and a third bomb, believed to be a car bomb like the first, went off at 9:45 a.m. outside a local office of the State Food and Drug Administration." [17]
The explosion blew most of the windows out of the local prosecutor's office, an eight-story building, and at least ten cars were destroyed. [5]
Many Chinese bloggers, weibo and Twitter users expressed sympathy for Qian Mingqi, with some calling him a "hero", and comparing him to Yang Jia , who killed Shanghai policemen after allegedly suffering mistreatment. Following the bombings, Qian's weibo page had attracted some 30,000 followers, before being shut down by Sina administrators. [18] The Christian Science Monitor reported that most of the online commentators regarded Qian's actions not as a terrorist attack, but as "righteous vengeance:" "The flood of supportive comments online since his death is a sign of widespread public frustration at the government's disdain for ordinary citizens." VOA reported on 27 May that the death of Qian has sounded an alarm bell for Chinese government, and one blogger has said on his Twitter account:"...history will always remember Qian." [19] [20]
In an interview, Li Chengpeng, one of China's most popular and influential bloggers, said "Qian was no Bin Laden , he was one of the weak, he had no way to express himself nor defend his rights." [21]
The Associated Press explained the outpouring of sympathy for Qian by observing that many citizens could relate to his tale of victimization at the hands of authorities, and to his frustration at the lack of channels to seek redress. The Associated Press observed that "Qian's grievances resonate widely in China, where land disputes have mushroomed amid a fast-paced economic boom. Standoffs between tenants and developers often turn violent, with homeowners beaten by thugs or even crushed by bulldozers. Other tenants have set themselves on fire rather than face eviction." [22]
The state-run Global Times newspaper issued a report after the bombings calling for a condemnation of the violence, but also proposed that more needed to be done to understand why individuals like Qian are occasionally driven to lash out. The article quoted Mao Shoulong, a professor of public policy at Renmin University of China , saying that while extreme actions to seek redress should not be encouraged in any way, "At the same time, authorities should learn to open smoother channels for the public to file their complaints before problems turn into confrontations and then violence." [23]
"Despite enormous attention being paid to the cause of the attack, we must lament the deaths of innocent people whose families and friends are now suffering...This horrendous act, no matter its origin, deserves the most vehement condemnation," the author said in one article with title "Horrendous attacks deserve public condemnation" in the observer column of the Global Times.

To Found5dollar Please list the strong relationship between the incident and the censorship. I strongly hate internet censorship, but we should not emphasize this here. If you can type and read Chinese, you can easily find various Chinese news about this incident. Truthdigger 04:14, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
It is not beign emphasized, a few sentances, sourced, about how first responders to the site dealt with the media by erasing pictures and confiscating materials is extremely notable. The burden of proof to it's non-notability lies of you. The information is sourced and is related to the event. Once the article expands, hopefully with your help, a smaller percent will be devoted to the censorship because the rest of the article will have more mass. Please do not delete the section again untill you can prove that sourced information directly related to peopel involved with the event does not belong. -- Found5dollar ( talk ) 04:23, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
You didn't give the strong connection between a bombing and the censorship. And obviously, you can easily access to this incident both in English and Chinese. So I will insist deleting the unimportant and not-related parts and focus on the truth and progress behind this incident. I hope you can do some work to improve this part. Truthdigger 04:33, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
There was a bombing, people took pictures of it, reliable sources say the cops deleted said pictures. Censorship. I don't know how one can have any stronger of a connection.-- Found5dollar ( talk ) 04:46, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Don't use feel, please give reasons. List the logical relationship. Thanks. Don't be the judge. ( talk ) 04:58, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
By the way, I found that this incident may match up the requirement of this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:N/CA#Criminal_acts
Maybe this is not suitable for an article,a better place to put his article is wikinews. Don't be the judge. ( talk ) 05:02, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
This article does not fall under "Criminal Acts." Please do not blank the page again. It is counterproductive.-- Found5dollar ( talk ) 05:19, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
You just deleted the "Censorship" section again statign that you can nto find the information in the reference. the ref clearly states "local police deleted photographs of the explosions taken by passersby, and later blocked roads in surrounding neighbourhoods. Little information was released by local authorities. " i am reinstating the section. please do nto delete it again-- Found5dollar ( talk ) 05:28, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Please supply the official orginal report about the suspect. And also there is no evidence that the external link is from you so called "suspect". Don't be the judge. ( talk ) 05:32, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
I have brought this article to the attention of the administrators noticeboard as you continue to delete sourced information as well as posts by other users on your talk page.-- Found5dollar ( talk ) 05:43, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
I am here to invite everyone to expand the incident. The background of the suspect and social debate content. Thanks. Truthdigger 12:17, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Right now this article only has 10 references. I'm sure there are more reliable sources covering this incident. In particular, this article should cite whatever the state media are now saying about it. {Heroeswithmetaphors talk} 13:44, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Ref 8 and 10 have exact the same content(It seems that one website reprint the news.). Can you just change to one link? MECHEMENG ( talk ) 22:49, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
How about 2011 Jiangxi bombings? (Heroeswithmetaphors) talk 18:40, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
The current title is much better. Truthdigger 19:07, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Using simply "Jiangxi bombings" is too imprecise, as Jiangxi is a very big place. The use of the x (comma) y format is necessary; the current title distinguishes 撫州 "Fuzhou City" in Jiangxi Province to the 福州 " Fuzhou City" located in Fujian Province. --  李博杰  |

Wife quote in Chinese[ edit ]
Voice of America is quoting 钱明奇妻子 so I don't think "she has been dead for 2 years"
事发当天，一位自称是钱明奇妻子的人在微博上留言说，“今天抚州爆炸，摧毁的是几辆车子，几座房子，唤醒的是这个社会的良心，揭露的是强拆的黑暗。我丈夫一条生命值的[得]。” 江西爆炸案在网上引发热议 2011年 5月 27日
(Heroeswithmetaphors) talk 20:52, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Translation: Day of the incident, one claiming to be the wife of the man the money minch microblogging on the message said, "Today Fuzhou explosion destroyed a few more cars, several houses, awakened the conscience of this society, exposing the demolitions the dark. my husband the value of a life [was]. -- Kudpung กุดผึ้ง ( talk ) 06:25, 28 May 2011 (UTC)
Qian Mingqi lost his wife. In Chinese, "据了解，钱明奇丧妻，有两子一女，均在外务工。他家境一般。1995年左右，因抚临公路改造，他经历了第一次拆迁。2001年左右，他刚盖好的五层楼房又因京福高速而被拆迁。" 江西连环爆炸嫌犯微博心路 MECHEMENG ( talk ) 22:54, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Translation: It is understood that the money minch death of his wife, two sons and one daughter were overseas workers. His family in general. Around 1995, due to temporary road reconstruction ask, he witnessed the first demolition. Around 2001, he had just covered the five-story building was demolition because of Fuzhou. -- Kudpung กุดผึ้ง ( talk ) 06:26, 28 May 2011 (UTC)
Another source of his wife's death.(Fuzhou Police Report) In Chinese "钱明奇妻子已去世多年，他有两子一女，都已成家育子。关于三个子女的情况，说法不一。钱明奇岳母唐水娇说，钱明奇大儿子一直带着妻女在外打工，二儿子和钱明奇住在一起做冰棺生意，女儿则外嫁他村。但钱明奇的一位邻居则说，钱明奇大儿子的妻子带着女儿走了，大儿子几乎不回家。二儿子在外打工，一年也就回来一两次，钱明奇基本一人住在家里。“七年了他没来过我家我没去过他家，他家做冰棺生意，那个东西拉进拉出很脏的，我都不去。”而另一位邻居也表示，认识是认识钱明奇，但只是见面时候点个头或者寒暄一句。"
Translation: Money minch wife has died for many years, he has two sons and a daughter, have a family child-rearing. Three children on the situation vary. Tang Shui Jiao Qian minch mother said, the money has been minch son who work with his wife and daughter, two sons and live with the money to do the ice coffin minch business, his daughter is marrying his village. But money minch a neighbor said that the money the wife of the eldest son Minchin walked with her daughter, the eldest son almost did not come home. Two sons who work, will come back once or twice a year, the money minch basic one at home.

" while another neighbor said, knowledge is knowledge Minch money, but only when meeting or greeting a nod. Kudpung กุดผึ้ง ( talk ) 06:27, 28 May 2011 (UTC)
Note: All translations by Google. Kudpung กุดผึ้ง ( talk ) 06:29, 28 May 2011 (UTC)
nice propaganda from The Christian Science Monitor , they should look at the most liked comments in this CNN article [1] . Why are some people supporting Joseph Andrew Stack and this guy is a good question for the psychologists , but the section for that in this article is not neutral. Pilotkjl ( talk ) 19:15, 28 May 2011 (UTC)
A number of news organizations and bloggers have picked up on the same angle as the CSM. I'm not sure why you think it constitutes propaganda, nor do I see how the parallel to Joseph Andrew Stack is relevant.
I would like to work on the response section to make it more complete. I have yet to find secondary sources that report on anything but the outpouring of sympathy that Qian received from the Chinese public, though I admittedly have not looked very hard. If you find some, you are most welcome to add them in, or direct me to them and I can do it. I also want to make clear that by reporting information on the expressions of popular support that Qian received, these news organizations are not endorsing that perspective. They are reporting on it because it says something about the state of China today, about the frustrations of its people and their attitudes on acceptable forms of protest, etc. I think it's worthy of inclusion on Wikipedia for the same reason—not because I endorse violence. Homunculus ( duihua ) 04:56, 29 May 2011 (UTC)
One thing we need to pay attention, the other two victims are weak people ( security guards ). Not government administrators. We need to find some news about response for their death. MECHEMENG ( talk ) 05:03, 29 May 2011 (UTC)
Good idea. As I said, I have yet to find good secondary sources commenting on that aspect of the response, but that owes to not looking very hard. If you find something, please add it in. Homunculus ( duihua ) 05:15, 29 May 2011 (UTC)
If no one protests, I am going to remove the tags on the section now that it's been updated. Homunculus ( duihua ) 04:55, 31 May 2011 (UTC)

To Found5dollar Please list the strong relationship between the incident and the censorship. I strongly hate internet censorship, but we should not emphasize this here. If you can type and read Chinese, you can easily find various Chinese news about this incident. Truthdigger 04:14, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
It is not beign emphasized, a few sentances, sourced, about how first responders to the site dealt with the media by erasing pictures and confiscating materials is extremely notable. The burden of proof to it's non-notability lies of you. The information is sourced and is related to the event. Once the article expands, hopefully with your help, a smaller percent will be devoted to the censorship because the rest of the article will have more mass. Please do not delete the section again untill you can prove that sourced information directly related to peopel involved with the event does not belong. -- Found5dollar ( talk ) 04:23, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
You didn't give the strong connection between a bombing and the censorship. And obviously, you can easily access to this incident both in English and Chinese. So I will insist deleting the unimportant and not-related parts and focus on the truth and progress behind this incident. I hope you can do some work to improve this part. Truthdigger 04:33, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
There was a bombing, people took pictures of it, reliable sources say the cops deleted said pictures. Censorship. I don't know how one can have any stronger of a connection.-- Found5dollar ( talk ) 04:46, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Don't use feel, please give reasons. List the logical relationship. Thanks. Don't be the judge. ( talk ) 04:58, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
By the way, I found that this incident may match up the requirement of this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:N/CA#Criminal_acts
Maybe this is not suitable for an article,a better place to put his article is wikinews. Don't be the judge. ( talk ) 05:02, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
This article does not fall under "Criminal Acts." Please do not blank the page again. It is counterproductive.-- Found5dollar ( talk ) 05:19, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
You just deleted the "Censorship" section again statign that you can nto find the information in the reference. the ref clearly states "local police deleted photographs of the explosions taken by passersby, and later blocked roads in surrounding neighbourhoods. Little information was released by local authorities. " i am reinstating the section. please do nto delete it again-- Found5dollar ( talk ) 05:28, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Please supply the official orginal report about the suspect. And also there is no evidence that the external link is from you so called "suspect". Don't be the judge. ( talk ) 05:32, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
I have brought this article to the attention of the administrators noticeboard as you continue to delete sourced information as well as posts by other users on your talk page.-- Found5dollar ( talk ) 05:43, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
I am here to invite everyone to expand the incident. The background of the suspect and social debate content. Thanks. Truthdigger 12:17, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Right now this article only has 10 references. I'm sure there are more reliable sources covering this incident. In particular, this article should cite whatever the state media are now saying about it. {Heroeswithmetaphors talk} 13:44, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Ref 8 and 10 have exact the same content(It seems that one website reprint the news.). Can you just change to one link? MECHEMENG ( talk ) 22:49, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
How about 2011 Jiangxi bombings? (Heroeswithmetaphors) talk 18:40, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
The current title is much better. Truthdigger 19:07, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Using simply "Jiangxi bombings" is too imprecise, as Jiangxi is a very big place. The use of the x (comma) y format is necessary; the current title distinguishes 撫州 "Fuzhou City" in Jiangxi Province to the 福州 " Fuzhou City" located in Fujian Province. --  李博杰  |

Wife quote in Chinese[ edit ]
Voice of America is quoting 钱明奇妻子 so I don't think "she has been dead for 2 years"

Another source of his wife's death.(Fuzhou Police Report) In Chinese "钱明奇妻子已去世多年，他有两子一女，都已成家育子。关于三个子女的情况，说法不一。钱明奇岳母唐水娇说，钱明奇大儿子一直带着妻女在外打工，二儿子和钱明奇住在一起做冰棺生意，女儿则外嫁他村。但钱明奇的一位邻居则说，钱明奇大儿子的妻子带着女儿走了，大儿子几乎不回家。二儿子在外打工，一年也就回来一两次，钱明奇基本一人住在家里。“七年了他没来过我家我没去过他家，他家做冰棺生意，那个东西拉进拉出很脏的，我都不去。”而另一位邻居也表示，认识是认识钱明奇，但只是见面时候点个头或者寒暄一句。"

Note: All translations by Google. Kudpung กุดผึ้ง ( talk ) 06:29, 28 May 2011 (UTC)
nice propaganda from The Christian Science Monitor , they should look at the most liked comments in this CNN article [1] . Why are some people supporting Joseph Andrew Stack and this guy is a good question for the psychologists , but the section for that in this article is not neutral. Pilotkjl ( talk ) 19:15, 28 May 2011 (UTC)
A number of news organizations and bloggers have picked up on the same angle as the CSM. I'm not sure why you think it constitutes propaganda, nor do I see how the parallel to Joseph Andrew Stack is relevant.
I would like to work on the response section to make it more complete. I have yet to find secondary sources that report on anything but the outpouring of sympathy that Qian received from the Chinese public, though I admittedly have not looked very hard. If you find some, you are most welcome to add them in, or direct me to them and I can do it. I also want to make clear that by reporting information on the expressions of popular support that Qian received, these news organizations are not endorsing that perspective. They are reporting on it because it says something about the state of China today, about the frustrations of its people and their attitudes on acceptable forms of protest, etc. I think it's worthy of inclusion on Wikipedia for the same reason—not because I endorse violence.

The 2011 Fuzhou bombings ( Simplified Chinese : 抚州市连环爆炸案; Pinyin : Fǔzhōu shì liánhuán bàozhà àn) were three separate, synchronized explosions at government buildings in Fuzhou, Jiangxi , China on the morning of 26 May 2011. At least three people died, and at least seven were injured. The perpetrator, 52-year-old Qian Mingqi, was initially reported possibly among those killed in the blasts, leading China's state run news agencies to label it a suicide bombing . The Jiangxi Provincial Public Security Department later confirmed that the suspect died at the scene .
The three explosions occurred between 9:18 and 9:45am CST (0100 UTC). The first blast occurred in a parking lot outside the offices of the city prosecutor, the second inside a district administration office, and the third explosion hit the city's food and drug agency. Two of the bombs were placed inside cars parked just outside of the buildings. The official Xinhua news agency had posted a news article on its website saying the bombs were planted by a disgruntled farmer who was dissatisfied with the outcome of a court case , but by 1pm on the day of the bombing the article had been removed from the site .

Nadahan wedding bombing - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The Nadahan wedding bombing was a suicide attack on a wedding party, which occurred on 9 June 2010 at around 21:00 local time (16:30 GMT) in the village of Nadahan in ... Contents
The enormous explosion occurred in a men-only area of the wedding party. [3] They were all sitting down and eating at the time of the event. [4] A white-clothed boy under the age of 13 wandered in and approached within 15 feet of the dinner tables before fiddling with the bomb attached to his vest, causing a chaotic scene. [5] There was a ball of fire and some smoke. [4] The women were elsewhere, inside another building. [4] Some of those killed were children. [3] The groom was among the wounded. [3] His brother died. [5] His bride remained unharmed throughout the incident. [4]
At least three police officers from Afghanistan were involved in the wedding. [4] Others suggested the attack was intended for 17 of the guests who were members of an anti-Taliban guard group, which had once been encouraged by the American Special Operations Forces before they gave up on it. [6] Blood donations were requested via television. [3] The coffins of the dead were lined adjacent to the mortuary. [3]
A group of investigators was sent to the village by Afghanistan's Interior Ministry. [5]
NATO issued a statement claiming none of their soldiers were behind it. [4] The Taliban were instead blamed by the NATO troops; however, the Taliban has stated that they were not responsible for the attack, [3] even condemning it as "a brutal act". [3] Deputy commander of NATO forces, Lt. Gen. Nick Parker , described it as "ruthless violence" and claimed these were "sickening and indiscriminate tactics to try to intimidate the citizens of Afghanistan". [4]
A military spokesperson representing the United States said the attack had not been an airstrike carried out by his country. [4] He dismissed speculation to the contrary as "Taliban misinformation". [4]
President Hamid Karzai stated his condemnation and requested "a thorough investigation". [4] Karzai, in the presence of the United Kingdom's Prime Minister David Cameron (who was visiting Afghanistan for the first official time), labelled it "a crime of massive inhuman proportions". [7]
Tooryalai Wesa , governor of the Kandahar Province , spoke at a news conference in Nadahan after the attack had happened and demonstrated a piece of metal he had found which he said resembled a suicide bomb. [4]
United Nations Special Representative for Afghanistan Staffan de Mistura said it was an "outrageous act" and that "to specifically target people who were gathering at a moment of happiness to celebrate a wedding shows a total disregard for civilian life". [5]

Battle of Doan - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Nadahan wedding bombing; Hamkari; Dragon Strike; Baawar; Kandahar; Eastern Afghanistan. Hazar Qadam; Anaconda ; ... Nadahan (2010) Logar (2011) Nimruz (2011) LT
LT
Several Bushmaster vehicles
US air support and QRF assets Unknown number of Taliban fighters Casualties and losses 1 Australian wounded
1 Bushmaster destroyed Unconfirmed number of fighters killed/or injured
1 local arrested on suspicion.
The village of Doan is located in the western part of Oruzgan Province which is often called the "Wild West of Oruzgan" due to the high level of violent attacks. One of the most remote outposts in Oruzgan is Patrol Base Tinsley, which is where Australians train their Afghan colleagues. Part of their training involves patrols in order to halt the advance of the Taliban. The Australians and ANA conducted a three day joint patrol to the village of Doan. During this time, they were constantly being engaged by sporadic fire from the 'green zone'.
On 9 September 2011 a joint patrol of Australians from Combat Team Charlie, Mentoring Task Force 3 and ANA troops came under Taliban fire near Doan. The patrol made its way through the village before exchanging fire on the outskirts of Doan. RPGs and a mortar crew added to the coalition's firepower. During the battle, a Bushmaster vehicle was destroyed when it hit an IED whilst under fire, a digger was wounded and airlifted to hospital. The Taliban eventually fortified themselves on a hill and managed to counter all attacks. The fighting dragged on well into the night until an airstrike was called in and US fighter jets bombarded Taliban positions, ending the battle.
The Australian who was wounded was airlifted to a Coalition hospital in Tarin Kowt and treated for his injuries. A squad of US soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division who had been assigned as the security force for the region's Civil Affairs forces, assisted in the Quick Reaction Force (QRF), casevac, and resupply of Australian forces after providing QRF and casevac to American Special Forces who were concurrently operating north of their position in the Kod Valley. It is estimated that a small number of Taliban were killed during the battle, primarily due to the airstrike. During the battle, the Australians arrested a local Afghan on suspicion of aiding the Taliban. No civilians were killed or injured and the village of Doan was secured. [1] [2] [3]

Attack type
Car bombing
The October 2010 Abuja attacks otherwise 2010 Nigeria Independence Day attacks, were two car bombings carried out against crowds celebrating the fiftieth anniversary (golden jubilee) of Nigeria 's independence in the capital city of Abuja on the morning of October 1, 2010. The attacks left 12 dead and 17 injured. According to multiple sources, [1] [2] the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) issued a warning less than an hour before the first bomb stating the location, near Eagle Square (the venue of the celebration), and the time, around 10:30 a.m., of planned bombings. [3]
The first blast occurred around 10:30 a.m., emergency services arrived at the scene and then happened the second blast. [2]
Reactions and investigation[ edit ]
A former leader of MEND, Henry Okah , was arrested in South Africa following the twin car bombings. [4] Okah denied accusations of planning the bombings and was disowned by MEND. [5] Police in Nigeria also detained Raymond Dokpesi , campaign manager for former Nigerian leader Ibrahim Babangida , for questioning over the bombing. Dokpesi was later released and said his arrest was political in nature. [6]
Nigerian paper This Day reported that British intelligence was warned of a plot against the 50th anniversary celebrations, and this was the reason Gordon Brown and Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester cancelled their trips to Nigeria for the celebration. [7]

Boko Haram ("Western education is forbidden"), officially called Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'Awati Wal-Jihad ("People Committed to the Prophet's Teachings for Propagation and Jihad"), is a terrorist, militant and Islamist movement based in northeast Nigeria with additional activities in Chad, Niger and Cameroon.[4] The group is led by Abubakar Shekau, and membership has been estimated to number between a few hundred and a few thousand. The group is designated as a terrorist organization by New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and the United Nations Security Council, which declared it an al-Qaeda affiliate and imposed the al-Qaeda sanctions regime on the group.[4][15][16] Boko Haram killed more than 5,000 civilians between July 2009 and June 2014, including at least 2,000 in the first half of 2014, in attacks occurring mainly in northeast, north-central and central Nigeria.[17][18][19] Corruption in the security services and human rights abuses committed by them have hampered efforts to counter the unrest.[20][21] Since 2009 Boko Haram have abducted more than 500 men,[22][23] women and children, including the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls from Chibok in April 2014.[24] 650,000 people had fled the conflict zone by August 2014, an increase of 200,000 since May; by the end of the year 1.5 million had fled.[25][26] After its founding in 2002, Boko Haram's increasing radicalisation led to a violent uprising in July 2009 in which its leader was executed. Its unexpected resurgence, following a mass prison break in September 2010, was accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks, initially against soft targets, and progressing in 2011 to include suicide bombings on police buildings and the United Nations office in Abuja. The government's establishment of a state of emergency at the beginning of 2012, extended in the following year to cover the entire northeast of the country, resulted in a marked increase in both security force abuses and militant attacks. The Nigerian military proved ineffective in countering the insurgency, hampered by an entrenched culture of official corruption. Since mid-2014, the militants have been in control of swathes of territory in and around their home state of Borno, but have not captured the capital of Borno state, Maiduguri, where the group was originally based. As of January 2015, Boko Haram controlled towns and villages across about 20,000 square miles, an area the size of Belgium, in the states of Borno and Yobe.[

President Goodluck Jonathan on MEND in 2010 And 2015
Flagging-off of his presidential campaign in Lagos today, President Goodluck Jonathan told a crowd of party faithful that the leader of the Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND), Henry Okah, was procured by some Nigerians to assassinate him. Nigerian and South African intelligence, he said, however foiled the plot. In 2010, when MEND claimed responsibility for the Nigeria’s Independence Day bomb explosions in Abuja, Mr. Jonathan absolved the group of blame even when MEND announced that Jonathan had asked it to blame Northerners for the explosions. Speaking further today, Mr. Jonathan suggested that MEND's endorsement of Buhari for next month’s presidential election means that Mr. Okah has political connections with the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential candidate, Muhammadu Buhari.

At the 2006 census, the city of Abuja had a population of 778,567, making it one of the top ten most populous cities in Nigeria.
Other sights include the Nigerian National Mosque and the Nigerian National Christian Centre . The city is served by the Nnamdi Azikiwe International Airport , while Zuma Rock lies nearby. Abuja is known for being the best purpose-built city in Africa as well as being one of the wealthiest and most expensive; however, the population on the semi-developed edges of the city are living in rural areas such as Karu , Nasarawa State .

Later he enrolled at Kishinchand Chellaram College , before studying medicine at Topiwala National Medical College and Nair Hospital and later the University of Mumbai , where he obtained a Bachelor of Medicine and Surgery (MBBS).

Boko Haram ("Western education is forbidden"), officially called Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'Awati Wal-Jihad ("People Committed to the Prophet's Teachings for Propagation and Jihad"), is a terrorist, militant and Islamist movement based in northeast Nigeria with additional activities in Chad, Niger and Cameroon.[4] The group is led by Abubakar Shekau, and membership has been estimated to number between a few hundred and a few thousand. The group is designated as a terrorist organization by New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and the United Nations Security Council, which declared it an al-Qaeda affiliate and imposed the al-Qaeda sanctions regime on the group.[4][15][16] Boko Haram killed more than 5,000 civilians between July 2009 and June 2014, including at least 2,000 in the first half of 2014, in attacks occurring mainly in northeast, north-central and central Nigeria.[17][18][19] Corruption in the security services and human rights abuses committed by them have hampered efforts to counter the unrest.[20][21] Since 2009 Boko Haram have abducted more than 500 men,[22][23] women and children, including the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls from Chibok in April 2014.[24] 650,000 people had fled the conflict zone by August 2014, an increase of 200,000 since May; by the end of the year 1.5 million had fled.[25][26] After its founding in 2002, Boko Haram's increasing radicalisation led to a violent uprising in July 2009 in which its leader was executed. Its unexpected resurgence, following a mass prison break in September 2010, was accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks, initially against soft targets, and progressing in 2011 to include suicide bombings on police buildings and the United Nations office in Abuja. The government's establishment of a state of emergency at the beginning of 2012, extended in the following year to cover the entire northeast of the country, resulted in a marked increase in both security force abuses and militant attacks. The Nigerian military proved ineffective in countering the insurgency, hampered by an entrenched culture of official corruption. Since mid-2014, the militants have been in control of swathes of territory in and around their home state of Borno, but have not captured the capital of Borno state, Maiduguri, where the group was originally based. As of January 2015, Boko Haram controlled towns and villages across about 20,000 square miles, an area the size of Belgium, in the states of Borno and Yobe.[

President Goodluck Jonathan on MEND in 2010 And 2015
Flagging-off of his presidential campaign in Lagos today, President Goodluck Jonathan told a crowd of party faithful that the leader of the Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND), Henry Okah, was procured by some Nigerians to assassinate him. Nigerian and South African intelligence, he said, however foiled the plot. In 2010, when MEND claimed responsibility for the Nigeria’s Independence Day bomb explosions in Abuja, Mr. Jonathan absolved the group of blame even when MEND announced that Jonathan had asked it to blame Northerners for the explosions. Speaking further today, Mr. Jonathan suggested that MEND's endorsement of Buhari for next month’s presidential election means that Mr. Okah has political connections with the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential candidate, Muhammadu Buhari.

2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks - Wikipedia, the ... 2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Jump to: navigation, search. 2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks; Site of the attacks
Deaths
6 Israeli civilians, 1 Israeli soldier, 1 Israeli Yamam policeman, 5 Egyptian soldiers, 10 attackers [2]
Non-fatal injuries
Perpetrators
Presumably 12 assailants. Israel has stated that the attacks were orchestrated by the Gaza based Popular Resistance Committees , who deny involvement. [4] Egyptian sources report that three of the attackers were Sinai-based Egyptians. [2] [5]
On August 18, 2011, a series of cross-border attacks with parallel attacks and mutual cover was carried out in southern Israel on Highway 12 near the Egyptian border by a squad of presumably 12 militants in four groups. [2] The attacks occurred after Israel's interior security service Shin Bet had warned of an attack by militants in the region and Israeli troops had been stationed in the area. [6] The militants first opened fire at an Egged No. 392 bus as it was traveling on Highway 12 in the Negev near Eilat . [3] [7] Several minutes later, a bomb was detonated next to an Israeli army patrol along Israel's border with Egypt. In a third attack, an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians. [8] Eight Israelis – six civilians, one Yamam special unit police sniper and one Golani Brigade soldier—were killed in the multiple-stage attack. [9] [10] The Israel Defense Forces reported eight attackers killed, and Egyptian security forces reported killing another two. [2]
Five Egyptian soldiers were also killed. According to Egypt, they were killed by Israeli security forces chasing militants across the Egyptian border, while an Israeli military officer initially said they were killed by a suicide bomber who had fled across the border into Egypt. [11] The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between Egypt and Israel and led to mass protests outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo. According to media reports, Egypt threatened to withdraw its ambassador to Israel, but Egypt's foreign minister later denied this. [2] Israel expressed regret over the deaths, and sent a letter of apology to Egypt. [12] The IDF was ordered to conduct a military probe of the incident, [13] [14] and on August 25, 2011, Israel agreed to a joint investigation with Egypt of the events. [15]
The identity of the attackers, three of whom were reportedly Egyptian, [16] is not widely agreed upon, [17] and so far no group took responsibility for the attacks. The Israeli government accused the Palestinian Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), a Gaza -based coalition of Palestinian militant groups, of orchestrating the attacks, [18] but the PRC denies involvement. [19] However, Israel attacked seven targets in the Gaza Strip immediately after the terror attacks in the Negev, killing five members of the PRC, including its leader. [20]
On August 21, 2011, an informal ceasefire was called by Israel and Hamas after days of escalating violence in which fifteen Palestinians were killed and many were wounded. More than 100 rockets and mortar shells were fired from Gaza into Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding more than a dozen. [21] The ceasefire was broken almost immediately by rocket fire from Gaza on southern Israel, followed by retaliatory Israeli airstrikes, killing at least seven Palestinians, among them two leaders of the Islamic Jihad . On August 26, 2011, Gaza militants called a second truce. [22] On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , Zuhir al-Qaisi , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks. [23]

Egypt–Israel border north of Eilat near where the attacks took place. Egypt is on the left, Israel on the right.
The southern part of Israeli Highway 12 runs adjacent to Israel's border with Egypt. It was the scene of previous shooting attacks in the 1990s.[ citation needed ] In the late 2000s, the Israeli government decided to build the Israel–Egypt barrier , although by 2011 only 10% of it had been completed, none close to the site of the attack. [24]
Following the 2011 Egyptian revolution militant organizations increased their activity in the Sinai Peninsula and Al-Qaeda militants groups were established, [25] after Egyptian police had all but completely withdrawn from the northern Sinai, dominated by Bedouin tribes. During the months preceding the cross-border attacks, Egypt reinforced its forces with about 1,000 additional soldiers in the Sinai Peninsula, with the consent of Israel, after a series of five bombings had disrupted the flow of natural gas to Israel. [26]
On July 30, militants staged an attack on an Egyptian police station in El-Arish, killing six. [27]
On August 2, a group claiming to be the Sinai wing of Al Qaeda declared its intention to create an Islamic caliphate in the Sinai. [28]
On August 14, 2011, Egyptian forces swept the Sinai Peninsula in search of terror cells. [29] Jordanian intelligence informed the Israelis that they had information about an impending terror attack in the south of Israel. [30] Two days prior to the attack, the Egyptian army captured four Islamist insurgents as they prepared to blow up a gas pipeline in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula. [31]
Israeli interior security service Shin Bet had warned of terrorist attacks being planned in the region in an area 80 kilometers long, presuming that they would take place at night. The warnings led to a massive deployment of IDF troops, [6] and the closing of Highway 12, which was reopened only on the day of the attack at the order of head of IDF's southern command Tal Russo . [32]
August 18 cross-border attacks and immediate Israeli response[ edit ]
The original attacks occurred in three coordinated stages. [8] They were carried out by 12 militants in four groups dispersed over an area 12 kilometers long. At least some of the attackers wore brown uniforms, similar to those used by the Egyptian Army . [2] Israeli military and police forces, in cooperation with Shin Bet , began pursuing the perpetrators immediately after the attacks commenced and locked down the area. [33]
The attacks commenced around 12:00 pm (UTC+2) near the Ein Netafim spring, on Highway 12 from Mitzpe Ramon to Eilat , when three militants spread out about 200 meters from one another, [10] armed with suicide bomb vests, grenades , RPGs , and machine guns opened fire on an Egged passenger bus on line 392, carrying mostly soldiers but also some civilians. [8] Seven passengers were wounded, most of them soldiers. [34] According to eyewitnesses, a white car was following the bus, and a group of people dressed in military uniforms got out and opened fire. The bus driver, Benny Belevsky, did not stop the bus and sped away, getting to an IDF post near the Netafim Border Crossing . [35]
The militants, dressed in brown uniforms resembling those of the Egyptian Army, then began attacking passing vehicles, waving white handkerchiefs to fool motorists. [2] One of the militants attacked a bus that drove by and detonated the suicide bomb belt he was wearing, killing himself and the bus driver, who had stopped the empty bus. [34] Another militant opened fire at a passing car and killed the female driver. The same militant then fired an RPG at an Israeli Air Force helicopter, but missed. An IDF jeep from the Golani Brigade then arrived at the scene and ran over the militant, killing him. [10] Another Golani Brigade jeep arrived, and ran over a roadside bomb. As the soldiers exited the damaged vehicle, the surviving militant opened fire at them. Soldiers and Yamam special police officers then located the militant and killed him in a gunbattle. Two other militants then opened fire at the from Egyptian territory. Israeli forces briefly crossed the border and killed both of the militants. One Israeli soldier was killed by friendly fire during the engagement and several soldiers were wounded. [36] [37] [38] [39] The Egyptian Army informed the IDF that its soldiers killed two more militants in the Sinai. [10]
In the third attack, which occurred around 12:35, mortar shells were fired at soldiers carrying out routine maintenance work at the security fence constructed along the border between Israel and Egypt. No one was hurt in the attack. [33] [40]
Around 13:30, not far from the first shooting incident, militants opened fire, including with an anti-tank missile , at a bus and private car on route 90, a desert road near the border with Jordan . According to medics, five people were killed in the attacks. [7] Seven people were wounded when another private vehicle was hit by an anti-tank missile. Eyewitnesses suggested that some of the attackers may have been wearing Egyptian Army uniforms. [41] Two IAF helicopters were called to the scene in order to evacuate those wounded.
IDF medic Anastasia Bagdalov was awarded military commendation for her response to the attack. She was a passenger on the bus that was attacked by militants. Begdlov used her bra as a tourniquet on a severely wounded passenger's artery.
Around 18:30, an Israeli patrol was fired on from the Egyptian border as it searched for militants. Israeli troops returned fire, and the shooting lasted for about an hour. A sniper from the Yamam special police unit was critically wounded and later died. News of the firefight interrupted a briefing by the Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Chief of Staff Benny Gantz . [42] [43] [44]
According to an Egyptian probe, Israeli troops entered the Sinai Peninsula chasing after the terrorists, exchanging fire with Egyptian police, and an Israeli helicopter fired two rockets at the terrorists and machine guns at Egyptian security personnel, killing an Egyptian officer and two policemen. [2] In a later incident, first reported as a suicide bomb attack, [45] another two Egyptian soldiers were killed, presumably also by Israeli forces. [2] Some Israeli sources claimed that an IDF investigation said that the IDF's attack helicopters avoided hitting the Egyptian military and that it remains unclear who fired the deadly shots. [46]
The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries and lead to mass protests in Cairo outside the Israeli embassy. [47]
Following the attack, all roads to and from Eilat were sealed off and operations at Ovda Airport were suspended. Roadblocks were set up at the entrance to the city of Eilat, and the area was locked down. Magen David Adom (Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service) raised its alert level and began preparing teams of paramedics and medical equipment. The Israeli Air Force sent in Eilat police deployed a large number of security forces and a police war room was opened at the Yoseftal Medical Center . Seven of the 29 injured people who were brought to the Yoseftal Medical Center were later transferred to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba . [30] The police asked the public to expect roadblocks at the entrance to Eilat amidst a heavy police presence in the city; however later in the day they added that no security incidents were under way in either Eilat or Beersheba despite calling for public vigilance and for the public-at-large to contact police in case of any suspicious individuals or items.

According to SITE a group calling itself Ansar Jerusalem claimed responsibility for the attack. [61] Nevertheless, Israel stated that it possesses evidence that indicate that the attacks were orchestrated by the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) in Gaza. [7] [62]
The (PRC) denied any involvement in the attack, though they praised it. According to PRC spokesman, "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems ". [63] According to Haaretz, there is doubt in Gaza, that members of the Popular Resistance Committees were behind the attack. The Egyptian daily Al-Masry Al-Youm reported that Egyptian security forces identified three of those responsible for the attack as Egyptians. [64]
Hamas, which governs Gaza, also denied involvement. [65] Sky News quoted Hamas spokesman Taher al-Nunu as saying: "The Palestinian government denies the accusations made by Barak about the operation in Eilat and affirms that there is no relation between the Gaza Strip and what happened near Eilat." [66] Hamas did, however, "praise" the attack. [67]
The Washington Times reported that US intelligence agencies linked Al Qaeda to the attack, claiming that either the PRC or the Gaza-based Jaish al Islam carried out the attacks. [68]
August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids
Casualties and losses None 14 Palestinians killed including at least 6 senior PRC militants; "scores" injured [69] [70]
At 18.00 the Israeli Air Force , [71] working with Shin Bet , [7] bombed a building used by Popular Resistance Committees' members in Rafah . Five PRC members were killed. Among the dead was the PRC's commander Kamal al-Nairab and military chief Immad Hammad, [72] [73] [74] who was suspected by Shin Bet of having planned the attacks. Of the remaining three, two were top members. [7] The two-year-old son of one of the militants, who was in the building when it was attacked, was also killed. [72] The airstrike occurred in the southern Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border. [75] [76] The PRC responded to the attack in saying that it vows "double" revenge. [7] Later, the Israeli Air Force launched a wave of attacks against targets in Gaza. A home near the former Palestinian intelligence headquarters was hit, reportedly killing one and wounding seventeen, and starting a large fire in the area. Israeli aircraft fired three missiles at a building used by Hamas security forces, and bombed a Hamas outpost in Khan Yunis . A missile was also fired at an open area in the southern Gaza Strip. Several targets were bombed in the northern Gaza Strip, including a building used by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades . Several targets were hit around the Philadelphi Route , believed to have been smuggling tunnels. [77] Numerous rocket-launching cells were attacked during the airstrikes. Three Palestinian militants were killed as they participated in the firing of rockets, and senior PRC member Samed Abdul Mu'ty Abed was killed while riding a motorcycle in northern Gaza. Another man was injured in the attack that killed Abed. [21] [78] [79]
The Israeli Air Force bombed two tunnels and one warehouse used for manufacturing weapons in southern Gaza and one site used for militant activities. The tunnels had been used to allow assailants to infiltrate Israel and carry out attacks according to a statement released by the IDF Spokesperson's Unit . The IAF identified direct hits, and all aircraft returned to Israel safely. [80] An airstrike in central Gaza targeting a car killed a Palestinian militant, his five-year-old son, and his brother. [73] [81]
On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed Zuhir al-Qaisi , the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks, and his collaborator, Mahmoud Hanani. [23]
Palestinian militant response to Israeli air strikes[ edit ]
After the Israeli Air Force attacked targets in the Gaza Strip, at least 10 rockets were fired into southern Israel, hitting the cities of Ashkelon and Beersheba , causing no injuries. [82] Two additional rockets landed in a courtyard of a Yeshiva in Ashdod , wounding 10 people and lightly damaging the buildings. [83] [84] The Abdullah Azzam Shaheed Brigade , a radical Islamic group affiliated with Al Qaeda , claimed responsibility for the attack. [85]
August 21st rocket attacks
Perpetrators
Over 80 rockets launched from Gaza hit cities in Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding over a dozen. [88] Seven rockets were fired almost simultaneously at Beersheba . The Iron Dome rocket defense system intercepted five of them, but one hit a residential area and killed Israeli Yossi Shushan. The Lachish subdistrict was hit by 28 rockets and the Negev subdistrict was hit by nine rockets. Four Israelis from the Bnei Shimon Regional Council were injured while running for shelter in Beersheba. Three Palestinians working in Israel were injured by Grad rockets after they exploded in a field in southern Ashdod . Vehicles and homes were damaged by rockets in Israeli cities near Gaza. [89] [90]
A Grad rocket exploded near the coastal city of Ashkelon in the night, though no injuries or damage were reported. It was unknown whether the rocket was intercepted by the Iron Dome , though it was confirmed that a second rocket was intercepted. [91] On August 21, an additional 12 rockets were fired at Israel. Three were intercepted by the Iron Dome in Ashkelon. One of the rockets hit an empty high school building in Beersheba. No one was in the school because "the city had canceled educational activities in light of the missile attacks that Palestinians in Gaza have been launching against the south in the last few days" according to Beersheba deputy mayor Heftziba Zohar. Later that night, a rocket killed a dog. [92] [93] [94]
Barrages of rockets were fired at Beersheba and Ashkelon. Half of them were intercepted by the Iron Dome . Mortar shells fired at farmland in the Eshkol Regional Council contained phosphorus , which is designed to create a more intense fire after detonation. [95] 40 rockets were fired on Sunday. [96] Several structures were damaged and a car caught fire after two rockets were fired at Ashkelon. A three-month-old infant was injured by glass splinters. [97]
A 13-year-old Palestinian boy, Mahmoud Abu Samra, was killed during the rocket attacks when a Palestinian Grad rocket fell short and landed in Gaza. [81]
An informal ceasefire was agreed upon between Israel and Hamas after the Arab League held an "urgent meeting" in Cairo on August 21, 2011. [98] Some 20 minutes after the ceasefire came into effect, a barrage of Qassam rockets and mortar shells was fired at Israel. The Iron Dome intercepted two rockets fired at Ashkelon. The Israeli Air Force attacked a militant cell in the northern Gaza Strip, wounding several people. The Islamic Jihad Movement and the Popular Resistance Committees said that they would not accept a ceasefire. [99]
On August 23, four Qassam rockets were fired at Israel in breach of the ceasefire. The rockets landed in open areas and caused no casualties, but one caused a brushfire which spread to an area near two civilian communities and threatened local greenhouses . Firefighters managed to contain the blaze before it did any damage. [100]
On August 24, more than 20 rockets were fired at Israeli communities. Grad rockets targeted the cities of Beersheba, Ashkelon, and Ofakim , injuring a nine-month-old baby. In Gaza, a senior Islamic Jihad member who funded the cross-border attacks was killed and two others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a car. Israeli jets also fired at two militants after they were seen preparing to fire rockets. Several hours after the strike, two mortar shells landed in the western Negev, causing no casualties. [101] Seven rockets were fired at Southern Israel, causing no damage or casualties. The Israeli Air Force attacked an Islamic Jihad rocket-launching cell, killing one militant. According to Palestinian media, the IDF fired shells at a militant squad in eastern Gaza after a rocket attack, but the cell escaped the strike. [102] On August 25, the Islamic Jihad Movement announced that it would abide by the ceasefire. The same day, 15 rockets and mortar shells hit Southern Israel, hitting open areas near Ashkelon and in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council . A mortar shell heavily damaged the Erez Crossing Terminal . Israel responded with airstrikes on several targets in the Gaza Strip. The two Islamic Jihad militants who had launched the mortar attack on the Erez Crossing were killed by an airstrike as traveled on their motorbike in northern Gaza. [103] On August 26, two Qassam rockets hit open areas in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council , and a Grad rocket exploded near Ashkelon. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility. [104]
On August 21, 2011, media reported that the Egyptian authorities were recalling the Egyptian ambassador in Israel in response to the killing of five Egyptian security officers by Israeli soldiers after the attacks near Eilat. [105] Egypt's foreign minister later stated that "at no point was there any intention on our part to recall our ambassador to Tel Aviv." [57]
Following the media reports about the killing of the Egyptian security officers, demonstrations against Israel erupted in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy. The demonstrators threw fire crackers at the building, unfurled a Palestinian flag, and called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in response to the killings. [11] Eventually a young Egyptian, Ahmed Al-Shahhat , climbed to the roof of the apartment building which houses the Israeli Embassy and removed the Israeli flag, replacing it with an Egyptian flag he had carried with him, becoming an instant folk hero in Egypt. The Israeli flag he had taken down was burned by protesters. [106] During the demonstrations which continued for several days, thousands of protesters, shouting anti Israel slogans, called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador, the recalling of Egyptian ambassador to Israel, a review of the Camp David Accords and the opening of the border with the Gaza Strip. [26] [107] On Friday, August 26, 2011, a demonstration announced as "Million-man demonstration to expel the Israeli ambassador" took place in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy, [108] drawing a few hundred protesters according to Haaretz . [109]
Israeli apology to Egypt[ edit ]
In October 2011, the New York Times reported that Israel had sent a letter of apology to Egypt for the killing of the Egyptian security officers by Israeli forces. [12]
 Israel:
President Shimon Peres said "The series of severe terror events are an attempt by terror organizations to murder innocent civilians within Israel, and to disrupt our lives" [110]
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that this was a "serious incident in which Israeli citizens were hurt and the country's sovereignty was harmed." [111] [112]
Defense Minister Ehud Barak stated "this is a grave terrorist incident in a number of locations. The incident reflects the weakness of Egypt's hold over Sinai and the spread of terrorist elements." [113] He also blamed the attacks on Gazans and pledged that Israel will respond. "The source of the terror incidents is Gaza and we will act against them with all our strength and determination." [114] He also expressed regret over the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers and ordered the IDF to conduct a military probe of the incident, and defense officials said it would likely be a joint probe with the participation of the Egyptian military. [13]
Palestinian Authority Chief-negotiator Saeb Erekat stated "Israel stands warned of any possible aggressive action or collective punishment measures against the Palestinian population in Gaza." Erekat stated that the Palestinian Authority is "against violence in all its forms," however, he added that such attacks should not be used by Israel as "a pretext for aggression."
Hamas denied responsibility for the attacks but praised the attacks "...since they were against soldiers." [115] Hamas warned Israel not to attack the Gaza Strip, following a statement by Defense Minister Ehud Barak that the IDF would strike back at the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza following a deadly triple terror attack. Hamas evacuated its command centers and sent senior commanders into hiding in anticipation of an IDF response. [116]
Popular Resistance Committee (PRC) spokesperson praised the attacks but said his group does not take any responsibility for launching it: "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems." [117]
Tawheed and Jihad , an al-Qaeda -linked group in the Gaza Strip, praised the attacks and said the "Jewish state should expect more." Over the internet, the group said "We in the Tawheed and Jihad group bless these blessed arms that pounded the fortifications of the vendetta-filled Jewish enemy in the so-called Eilat area in southern occupied Palestine." [118] [119]
Supranational
 United Nations – UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday strongly condemned the attack but called for restraint.

[122] [123]
The Middle East Quartet in a joint statement condemned the attacks and expressed concern "about the unsustainable situation in Gaza as well as the risk of escalation", and called for "restraint from all sides". [120]
International
 Bulgaria – The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks, saying: "We express our sincere condolences to the relatives of all victims. We are convinced that violence and terrorism cannot bring peace to the Middle East. Such acts do not help the efforts of the international community to bring the participants in the Middle East peace process back to the negotiations table." [124]
 Canada – Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird condemned the attacks, saying: “Canada condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in southern Israel today. These cowardly attacks, particularly on civilian targets, are abhorrent and criminal. On behalf of all Canadians, I send my heartfelt condolences to those affected by today’s vicious attacks.” Furthermore, Baird said: "“Israel has a right to defend itself against such terrorist acts in conformity with international humanitarian law. Those responsible for these horrific attacks must be held accountable.” [125]
 Costa Rica – The Ministry of Foreign Relations published an article condemning the attack, communicating its condolences to the people of Israel, specially to the victims and families of the murdered. The article stated that Costa Rica, as a peace loving country, respectful of all human rights, expresses its most energetic disapproval of any kind of violence or terrorist attacks, regardless of the motives behind it. [126]
 Germany – Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also condemned the attacks saying: "At this difficult hour we stand by the side of our Israeli friends. Those responsible must be prosecuted. Terror and violence must not be allowed to torpedo peace and negotiation efforts in the Middle East." [127]
 Italy – Italian Foreign Affairs Minister, Franco Frattini, condemned the "barbaric" attacks on southern Israel and warned the international community to prevent more such attacks due to the unrest in the Arab world. He said: "I would like to express my condolences and closeness to the Israeli people and government for the loss of life in the barbaric attacks today." [128]
 Netherlands – The Dutch Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms." [129]
 Norway – Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Gahr Støre "condemned in the strongest possible terms" the acts of terror, adding that Norway condemns all use of terror [130]
 United Kingdom – Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said that "I condemn these appalling and senseless acts of violence. As efforts for peace in the region continue, this brutality has no place, nor its perpetrators any excuse. My thoughts and prayers are with those killed and injured and I offer sincere condolences to their families and friends."
 USA – The State Department condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms," calling the attack "brutal and cowardly." Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said "We hope that those involved in the planning of these gruesome attacks will be brought to swift justice. We stand by Israel as our friend, partner, and ally – now and always." [131] She also added that "This violence only underscores our strong concerns about the security situation in the Sinai Peninsula. Recent commitments by the Egyptian government to address the security situation in the Sinai are important and we urge the Egyptian government to find a lasting resolution." [132]
 Russia – Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman by telephone. Lavrov expressed his condolences over the terrorist attacks in southern Israel. He condemned this extremist act, and "reaffirmed the immutable position of Russia that there can be no justification for terror or for those who use it as means to achieve their ends". He also said that "despite the gravity of the crime, it is necessary to exercise restraint and to avoid retaliatory steps from which innocent people may suffer". [133]
Following the attacks on Highway 12, Israel is reportedly to soon allow Egypt to deploy thousands of troops in the Sinai Peninsula in violation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, in which both countries agreed that the Sinai Peninsula will be a military-free zone. [15]
According to Haaretz, the IDF General Staff's investigation into the attack “was a source of great frustration”. An intelligence alert from the Shin Bet had led to a massive deployment of IDF troops in the area, but the forces' alertness had eroded, allowing the militants to track the IDF and choose their infiltration route. The decision not to close the road on the morning of the attack in spite of warnings from the Shin Beth is characterised as “understandable error of judgment, and definitely not a manifestation of carelessness”, whereas the appearance of the defense minister and the chief of staff at the scene of the incident while terrorists were still in the area is considered a serious security blunder that nearly culminated in another disaster.

<h1>2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks - Wikipedia, the </h1>
Site of the attacks
Deaths
6 Israeli civilians, 1 Israeli soldier, 1 Israeli Yamam policeman, 5 Egyptian soldiers, 10 attackers [2]
Non-fatal injuries
Perpetrators
Presumably 12 assailants. Israel has stated that the attacks were orchestrated by the Gaza based Popular Resistance Committees , who deny involvement. [4] Egyptian sources report that three of the attackers were Sinai-based Egyptians. [2] [5]
On August 18, 2011, a series of cross-border attacks with parallel attacks and mutual cover was carried out in southern Israel on Highway 12 near the Egyptian border by a squad of presumably 12 militants in four groups. [2] The attacks occurred after Israel's interior security service Shin Bet had warned of an attack by militants in the region and Israeli troops had been stationed in the area. [6] The militants first opened fire at an Egged No. 392 bus as it was traveling on Highway 12 in the Negev near Eilat . [3] [7] Several minutes later, a bomb was detonated next to an Israeli army patrol along Israel's border with Egypt. In a third attack, an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians. [8] Eight Israelis – six civilians, one Yamam special unit police sniper and one Golani Brigade soldier—were killed in the multiple-stage attack. [9] [10] The Israel Defense Forces reported eight attackers killed, and Egyptian security forces reported killing another two. [2]
Five Egyptian soldiers were also killed. According to Egypt, they were killed by Israeli security forces chasing militants across the Egyptian border, while an Israeli military officer initially said they were killed by a suicide bomber who had fled across the border into Egypt. [11] The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between Egypt and Israel and led to mass protests outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo. According to media reports, Egypt threatened to withdraw its ambassador to Israel, but Egypt's foreign minister later denied this. [2] Israel expressed regret over the deaths, and sent a letter of apology to Egypt. [12] The IDF was ordered to conduct a military probe of the incident, [13] [14] and on August 25, 2011, Israel agreed to a joint investigation with Egypt of the events. [15]
The identity of the attackers, three of whom were reportedly Egyptian, [16] is not widely agreed upon, [17] and so far no group took responsibility for the attacks. The Israeli government accused the Palestinian Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), a Gaza -based coalition of Palestinian militant groups, of orchestrating the attacks, [18] but the PRC denies involvement. [19] However, Israel attacked seven targets in the Gaza Strip immediately after the terror attacks in the Negev, killing five members of the PRC, including its leader. [20]
On August 21, 2011, an informal ceasefire was called by Israel and Hamas after days of escalating violence in which fifteen Palestinians were killed and many were wounded. More than 100 rockets and mortar shells were fired from Gaza into Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding more than a dozen. [21] The ceasefire was broken almost immediately by rocket fire from Gaza on southern Israel, followed by retaliatory Israeli airstrikes, killing at least seven Palestinians, among them two leaders of the Islamic Jihad . On August 26, 2011, Gaza militants called a second truce. [22] On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , Zuhir al-Qaisi , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks. [23]

The southern part of Israeli Highway 12 runs adjacent to Israel's border with Egypt. It was the scene of previous shooting attacks in the 1990s.[ citation needed ] In the late 2000s, the Israeli government decided to build the Israel–Egypt barrier , although by 2011 only 10% of it had been completed, none close to the site of the attack. [24]
Following the 2011 Egyptian revolution militant organizations increased their activity in the Sinai Peninsula and Al-Qaeda militants groups were established, [25] after Egyptian police had all but completely withdrawn from the northern Sinai, dominated by Bedouin tribes. During the months preceding the cross-border attacks, Egypt reinforced its forces with about 1,000 additional soldiers in the Sinai Peninsula, with the consent of Israel, after a series of five bombings had disrupted the flow of natural gas to Israel. [26]
On July 30, militants staged an attack on an Egyptian police station in El-Arish, killing six. [27]
On August 2, a group claiming to be the Sinai wing of Al Qaeda declared its intention to create an Islamic caliphate in the Sinai. [28]
On August 14, 2011, Egyptian forces swept the Sinai Peninsula in search of terror cells. [29] Jordanian intelligence informed the Israelis that they had information about an impending terror attack in the south of Israel. [30] Two days prior to the attack, the Egyptian army captured four Islamist insurgents as they prepared to blow up a gas pipeline in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula. [31]
Israeli interior security service Shin Bet had warned of terrorist attacks being planned in the region in an area 80 kilometers long, presuming that they would take place at night. The warnings led to a massive deployment of IDF troops, [6] and the closing of Highway 12, which was reopened only on the day of the attack at the order of head of IDF's southern command Tal Russo . [32]
August 18 cross-border attacks and immediate Israeli response[ edit ]
The original attacks occurred in three coordinated stages. [8] They were carried out by 12 militants in four groups dispersed over an area 12 kilometers long. At least some of the attackers wore brown uniforms, similar to those used by the Egyptian Army . [2] Israeli military and police forces, in cooperation with Shin Bet , began pursuing the perpetrators immediately after the attacks commenced and locked down the area. [33]
The attacks commenced around 12:00 pm (UTC+2) near the Ein Netafim spring, on Highway 12 from Mitzpe Ramon to Eilat , when three militants spread out about 200 meters from one another, [10] armed with suicide bomb vests, grenades , RPGs , and machine guns opened fire on an Egged passenger bus on line 392, carrying mostly soldiers but also some civilians. [8] Seven passengers were wounded, most of them soldiers. [34] According to eyewitnesses, a white car was following the bus, and a group of people dressed in military uniforms got out and opened fire. The bus driver, Benny Belevsky, did not stop the bus and sped away, getting to an IDF post near the Netafim Border Crossing . [35]
The militants, dressed in brown uniforms resembling those of the Egyptian Army, then began attacking passing vehicles, waving white handkerchiefs to fool motorists. [2] One of the militants attacked a bus that drove by and detonated the suicide bomb belt he was wearing, killing himself and the bus driver, who had stopped the empty bus. [34] Another militant opened fire at a passing car and killed the female driver. The same militant then fired an RPG at an Israeli Air Force helicopter, but missed. An IDF jeep from the Golani Brigade then arrived at the scene and ran over the militant, killing him. [10] Another Golani Brigade jeep arrived, and ran over a roadside bomb. As the soldiers exited the damaged vehicle, the surviving militant opened fire at them. Soldiers and Yamam special police officers then located the militant and killed him in a gunbattle. Two other militants then opened fire at the from Egyptian territory. Israeli forces briefly crossed the border and killed both of the militants. One Israeli soldier was killed by friendly fire during the engagement and several soldiers were wounded. [36] [37] [38] [39] The Egyptian Army informed the IDF that its soldiers killed two more militants in the Sinai. [10]
In the third attack, which occurred around 12:35, mortar shells were fired at soldiers carrying out routine maintenance work at the security fence constructed along the border between Israel and Egypt. No one was hurt in the attack. [33] [40]
Around 13:30, not far from the first shooting incident, militants opened fire, including with an anti-tank missile , at a bus and private car on route 90, a desert road near the border with Jordan . According to medics, five people were killed in the attacks. [7] Seven people were wounded when another private vehicle was hit by an anti-tank missile. Eyewitnesses suggested that some of the attackers may have been wearing Egyptian Army uniforms. [41] Two IAF helicopters were called to the scene in order to evacuate those wounded.
IDF medic Anastasia Bagdalov was awarded military commendation for her response to the attack. She was a passenger on the bus that was attacked by militants. Begdlov used her bra as a tourniquet on a severely wounded passenger's artery.
Around 18:30, an Israeli patrol was fired on from the Egyptian border as it searched for militants. Israeli troops returned fire, and the shooting lasted for about an hour. A sniper from the Yamam special police unit was critically wounded and later died. News of the firefight interrupted a briefing by the Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Chief of Staff Benny Gantz . [42] [43] [44]
According to an Egyptian probe, Israeli troops entered the Sinai Peninsula chasing after the terrorists, exchanging fire with Egyptian police, and an Israeli helicopter fired two rockets at the terrorists and machine guns at Egyptian security personnel, killing an Egyptian officer and two policemen. [2] In a later incident, first reported as a suicide bomb attack, [45] another two Egyptian soldiers were killed, presumably also by Israeli forces. [2] Some Israeli sources claimed that an IDF investigation said that the IDF's attack helicopters avoided hitting the Egyptian military and that it remains unclear who fired the deadly shots. [46]
The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries and lead to mass protests in Cairo outside the Israeli embassy. [47]
Following the attack, all roads to and from Eilat were sealed off and operations at Ovda Airport were suspended. Roadblocks were set up at the entrance to the city of Eilat, and the area was locked down. Magen David Adom (Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service) raised its alert level and began preparing teams of paramedics and medical equipment. The Israeli Air Force sent in Eilat police deployed a large number of security forces and a police war room was opened at the Yoseftal Medical Center . Seven of the 29 injured people who were brought to the Yoseftal Medical Center were later transferred to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba . [30] The police asked the public to expect roadblocks at the entrance to Eilat amidst a heavy police presence in the city; however later in the day they added that no security incidents were under way in either Eilat or Beersheba despite calling for public vigilance and for the public-at-large to contact police in case of any suspicious individuals or items.

According to SITE a group calling itself Ansar Jerusalem claimed responsibility for the attack. [61] Nevertheless, Israel stated that it possesses evidence that indicate that the attacks were orchestrated by the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) in Gaza. [7] [62]
The (PRC) denied any involvement in the attack, though they praised it. According to PRC spokesman, "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems ". [63] According to Haaretz, there is doubt in Gaza, that members of the Popular Resistance Committees were behind the attack. The Egyptian daily Al-Masry Al-Youm reported that Egyptian security forces identified three of those responsible for the attack as Egyptians. [64]
Hamas, which governs Gaza, also denied involvement. [65] Sky News quoted Hamas spokesman Taher al-Nunu as saying: "The Palestinian government denies the accusations made by Barak about the operation in Eilat and affirms that there is no relation between the Gaza Strip and what happened near Eilat." [66] Hamas did, however, "praise" the attack. [67]
The Washington Times reported that US intelligence agencies linked Al Qaeda to the attack, claiming that either the PRC or the Gaza-based Jaish al Islam carried out the attacks. [68]
August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids
Casualties and losses None 14 Palestinians killed including at least 6 senior PRC militants; "scores" injured [69] [70]
At 18.00 the Israeli Air Force , [71] working with Shin Bet , [7] bombed a building used by Popular Resistance Committees' members in Rafah . Five PRC members were killed. Among the dead was the PRC's commander Kamal al-Nairab and military chief Immad Hammad, [72] [73] [74] who was suspected by Shin Bet of having planned the attacks. Of the remaining three, two were top members. [7] The two-year-old son of one of the militants, who was in the building when it was attacked, was also killed. [72] The airstrike occurred in the southern Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border. [75] [76] The PRC responded to the attack in saying that it vows "double" revenge. [7] Later, the Israeli Air Force launched a wave of attacks against targets in Gaza. A home near the former Palestinian intelligence headquarters was hit, reportedly killing one and wounding seventeen, and starting a large fire in the area. Israeli aircraft fired three missiles at a building used by Hamas security forces, and bombed a Hamas outpost in Khan Yunis . A missile was also fired at an open area in the southern Gaza Strip. Several targets were bombed in the northern Gaza Strip, including a building used by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades . Several targets were hit around the Philadelphi Route , believed to have been smuggling tunnels. [77] Numerous rocket-launching cells were attacked during the airstrikes. Three Palestinian militants were killed as they participated in the firing of rockets, and senior PRC member Samed Abdul Mu'ty Abed was killed while riding a motorcycle in northern Gaza. Another man was injured in the attack that killed Abed. [21] [78] [79]
The Israeli Air Force bombed two tunnels and one warehouse used for manufacturing weapons in southern Gaza and one site used for militant activities. The tunnels had been used to allow assailants to infiltrate Israel and carry out attacks according to a statement released by the IDF Spokesperson's Unit . The IAF identified direct hits, and all aircraft returned to Israel safely. [80] An airstrike in central Gaza targeting a car killed a Palestinian militant, his five-year-old son, and his brother. [73] [81]
On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed Zuhir al-Qaisi , the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks, and his collaborator, Mahmoud Hanani. [23]
Palestinian militant response to Israeli air strikes[ edit ]
After the Israeli Air Force attacked targets in the Gaza Strip, at least 10 rockets were fired into southern Israel, hitting the cities of Ashkelon and Beersheba , causing no injuries. [82] Two additional rockets landed in a courtyard of a Yeshiva in Ashdod , wounding 10 people and lightly damaging the buildings. [83] [84] The Abdullah Azzam Shaheed Brigade , a radical Islamic group affiliated with Al Qaeda , claimed responsibility for the attack. [85]
August 21st rocket attacks
Perpetrators
Over 80 rockets launched from Gaza hit cities in Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding over a dozen. [88] Seven rockets were fired almost simultaneously at Beersheba . The Iron Dome rocket defense system intercepted five of them, but one hit a residential area and killed Israeli Yossi Shushan. The Lachish subdistrict was hit by 28 rockets and the Negev subdistrict was hit by nine rockets. Four Israelis from the Bnei Shimon Regional Council were injured while running for shelter in Beersheba. Three Palestinians working in Israel were injured by Grad rockets after they exploded in a field in southern Ashdod . Vehicles and homes were damaged by rockets in Israeli cities near Gaza. [89] [90]
A Grad rocket exploded near the coastal city of Ashkelon in the night, though no injuries or damage were reported. It was unknown whether the rocket was intercepted by the Iron Dome , though it was confirmed that a second rocket was intercepted. [91] On August 21, an additional 12 rockets were fired at Israel. Three were intercepted by the Iron Dome in Ashkelon. One of the rockets hit an empty high school building in Beersheba. No one was in the school because "the city had canceled educational activities in light of the missile attacks that Palestinians in Gaza have been launching against the south in the last few days" according to Beersheba deputy mayor Heftziba Zohar. Later that night, a rocket killed a dog. [92] [93] [94]
Barrages of rockets were fired at Beersheba and Ashkelon. Half of them were intercepted by the Iron Dome . Mortar shells fired at farmland in the Eshkol Regional Council contained phosphorus , which is designed to create a more intense fire after detonation. [95] 40 rockets were fired on Sunday. [96] Several structures were damaged and a car caught fire after two rockets were fired at Ashkelon. A three-month-old infant was injured by glass splinters. [97]
A 13-year-old Palestinian boy, Mahmoud Abu Samra, was killed during the rocket attacks when a Palestinian Grad rocket fell short and landed in Gaza. [81]
An informal ceasefire was agreed upon between Israel and Hamas after the Arab League held an "urgent meeting" in Cairo on August 21, 2011. [98] Some 20 minutes after the ceasefire came into effect, a barrage of Qassam rockets and mortar shells was fired at Israel. The Iron Dome intercepted two rockets fired at Ashkelon. The Israeli Air Force attacked a militant cell in the northern Gaza Strip, wounding several people. The Islamic Jihad Movement and the Popular Resistance Committees said that they would not accept a ceasefire. [99]
On August 23, four Qassam rockets were fired at Israel in breach of the ceasefire. The rockets landed in open areas and caused no casualties, but one caused a brushfire which spread to an area near two civilian communities and threatened local greenhouses . Firefighters managed to contain the blaze before it did any damage. [100]
On August 24, more than 20 rockets were fired at Israeli communities. Grad rockets targeted the cities of Beersheba, Ashkelon, and Ofakim , injuring a nine-month-old baby. In Gaza, a senior Islamic Jihad member who funded the cross-border attacks was killed and two others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a car. Israeli jets also fired at two militants after they were seen preparing to fire rockets. Several hours after the strike, two mortar shells landed in the western Negev, causing no casualties. [101] Seven rockets were fired at Southern Israel, causing no damage or casualties. The Israeli Air Force attacked an Islamic Jihad rocket-launching cell, killing one militant. According to Palestinian media, the IDF fired shells at a militant squad in eastern Gaza after a rocket attack, but the cell escaped the strike. [102] On August 25, the Islamic Jihad Movement announced that it would abide by the ceasefire. The same day, 15 rockets and mortar shells hit Southern Israel, hitting open areas near Ashkelon and in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council . A mortar shell heavily damaged the Erez Crossing Terminal . Israel responded with airstrikes on several targets in the Gaza Strip. The two Islamic Jihad militants who had launched the mortar attack on the Erez Crossing were killed by an airstrike as traveled on their motorbike in northern Gaza. [103] On August 26, two Qassam rockets hit open areas in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council , and a Grad rocket exploded near Ashkelon. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility. [104]
On August 21, 2011, media reported that the Egyptian authorities were recalling the Egyptian ambassador in Israel in response to the killing of five Egyptian security officers by Israeli soldiers after the attacks near Eilat. [105] Egypt's foreign minister later stated that "at no point was there any intention on our part to recall our ambassador to Tel Aviv." [57]
Following the media reports about the killing of the Egyptian security officers, demonstrations against Israel erupted in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy. The demonstrators threw fire crackers at the building, unfurled a Palestinian flag, and called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in response to the killings. [11] Eventually a young Egyptian, Ahmed Al-Shahhat , climbed to the roof of the apartment building which houses the Israeli Embassy and removed the Israeli flag, replacing it with an Egyptian flag he had carried with him, becoming an instant folk hero in Egypt. The Israeli flag he had taken down was burned by protesters. [106] During the demonstrations which continued for several days, thousands of protesters, shouting anti Israel slogans, called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador, the recalling of Egyptian ambassador to Israel, a review of the Camp David Accords and the opening of the border with the Gaza Strip. [26] [107] On Friday, August 26, 2011, a demonstration announced as "Million-man demonstration to expel the Israeli ambassador" took place in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy, [108] drawing a few hundred protesters according to Haaretz . [109]
Israeli apology to Egypt[ edit ]
In October 2011, the New York Times reported that Israel had sent a letter of apology to Egypt for the killing of the Egyptian security officers by Israeli forces. [12]
 Israel:
President Shimon Peres said "The series of severe terror events are an attempt by terror organizations to murder innocent civilians within Israel, and to disrupt our lives" [110]
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that this was a "serious incident in which Israeli citizens were hurt and the country's sovereignty was harmed." [111] [112]
Defense Minister Ehud Barak stated "this is a grave terrorist incident in a number of locations. The incident reflects the weakness of Egypt's hold over Sinai and the spread of terrorist elements." [113] He also blamed the attacks on Gazans and pledged that Israel will respond. "The source of the terror incidents is Gaza and we will act against them with all our strength and determination." [114] He also expressed regret over the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers and ordered the IDF to conduct a military probe of the incident, and defense officials said it would likely be a joint probe with the participation of the Egyptian military. [13]
Palestinian Authority Chief-negotiator Saeb Erekat stated "Israel stands warned of any possible aggressive action or collective punishment measures against the Palestinian population in Gaza." Erekat stated that the Palestinian Authority is "against violence in all its forms," however, he added that such attacks should not be used by Israel as "a pretext for aggression."
Hamas denied responsibility for the attacks but praised the attacks "...since they were against soldiers." [115] Hamas warned Israel not to attack the Gaza Strip, following a statement by Defense Minister Ehud Barak that the IDF would strike back at the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza following a deadly triple terror attack. Hamas evacuated its command centers and sent senior commanders into hiding in anticipation of an IDF response. [116]
Popular Resistance Committee (PRC) spokesperson praised the attacks but said his group does not take any responsibility for launching it: "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems." [117]
Tawheed and Jihad , an al-Qaeda -linked group in the Gaza Strip, praised the attacks and said the "Jewish state should expect more." Over the internet, the group said "We in the Tawheed and Jihad group bless these blessed arms that pounded the fortifications of the vendetta-filled Jewish enemy in the so-called Eilat area in southern occupied Palestine." [118] [119]
Supranational
 United Nations – UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday strongly condemned the attack but called for restraint. According to a UN statement, "the secretary-general hopes that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and brought to justice. He is concerned at the risk of escalation and calls for all to act with restraint." [121]
 European Union – EU Chief Catherine Ashton condemned the attacks, and said "I have learned with deep concern of the series of terrorist attacks that has taken place in Southern Israel today, including against civilian targets, and in which several Israelis are reported to have lost their lives and many more to have been injured. I condemn unreservedly all such acts of terror, extend my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in these attacks and express my wishes for a full and speedy recovery to the injured." [122] [123]
The Middle East Quartet in a joint statement condemned the attacks and expressed concern "about the unsustainable situation in Gaza as well as the risk of escalation", and called for "restraint from all sides". [120]
International
 Bulgaria – The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks, saying: "We express our sincere condolences to the relatives of all victims. We are convinced that violence and terrorism cannot bring peace to the Middle East. Such acts do not help the efforts of the international community to bring the participants in the Middle East peace process back to the negotiations table." [124]
 Canada – Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird condemned the attacks, saying: “Canada condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in southern Israel today. These cowardly attacks, particularly on civilian targets, are abhorrent and criminal. On behalf of all Canadians, I send my heartfelt condolences to those affected by today’s vicious attacks.” Furthermore, Baird said: "“Israel has a right to defend itself against such terrorist acts in conformity with international humanitarian law. Those responsible for these horrific attacks must be held accountable.” [125]
 Costa Rica – The Ministry of Foreign Relations published an article condemning the attack, communicating its condolences to the people of Israel, specially to the victims and families of the murdered. The article stated that Costa Rica, as a peace loving country, respectful of all human rights, expresses its most energetic disapproval of any kind of violence or terrorist attacks, regardless of the motives behind it. [126]
 Germany – Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also condemned the attacks saying: "At this difficult hour we stand by the side of our Israeli friends. Those responsible must be prosecuted. Terror and violence must not be allowed to torpedo peace and negotiation efforts in the Middle East." [127]
 Italy – Italian Foreign Affairs Minister, Franco Frattini, condemned the "barbaric" attacks on southern Israel and warned the international community to prevent more such attacks due to the unrest in the Arab world. He said: "I would like to express my condolences and closeness to the Israeli people and government for the loss of life in the barbaric attacks today." [128]
 Netherlands – The Dutch Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms." [129]
 Norway – Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Gahr Støre "condemned in the strongest possible terms" the acts of terror, adding that Norway condemns all use of terror [130]
 United Kingdom – Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said that "I condemn these appalling and senseless acts of violence. As efforts for peace in the region continue, this brutality has no place, nor its perpetrators any excuse. My thoughts and prayers are with those killed and injured and I offer sincere condolences to their families and friends."
 USA – The State Department condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms," calling the attack "brutal and cowardly." Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said "We hope that those involved in the planning of these gruesome attacks will be brought to swift justice. We stand by Israel as our friend, partner, and ally – now and always." [131] She also added that "This violence only underscores our strong concerns about the security situation in the Sinai Peninsula. Recent commitments by the Egyptian government to address the security situation in the Sinai are important and we urge the Egyptian government to find a lasting resolution." [132]
 Russia – Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman by telephone. Lavrov expressed his condolences over the terrorist attacks in southern Israel. He condemned this extremist act, and "reaffirmed the immutable position of Russia that there can be no justification for terror or for those who use it as means to achieve their ends". He also said that "despite the gravity of the crime, it is necessary to exercise restraint and to avoid retaliatory steps from which innocent people may suffer". [133]
Following the attacks on Highway 12, Israel is reportedly to soon allow Egypt to deploy thousands of troops in the Sinai Peninsula in violation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, in which both countries agreed that the Sinai Peninsula will be a military-free zone. [15]
According to Haaretz, the IDF General Staff's investigation into the attack “was a source of great frustration”. An intelligence alert from the Shin Bet had led to a massive deployment of IDF troops in the area, but the forces' alertness had eroded, allowing the militants to track the IDF and choose their infiltration route. The decision not to close the road on the morning of the attack in spite of warnings from the Shin Beth is characterised as “understandable error of judgment, and definitely not a manifestation of carelessness”, whereas the appearance of the defense minister and the chief of staff at the scene of the incident while terrorists were still in the area is considered a serious security blunder that nearly culminated in another disaster.

This article has recently been created in order to cover the Gaza arena of the 2011 southern Israel attacks . It seems there might be a problem covering the Gaza arena as a WP:DUE event, outside the context of the southern Israel attacks, as well as WP:RS relation to this arena as such. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:26, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
These attacks deserve an article of their own, not just a small section within an already excisting article. These attacks are notable - they led to truce between Israel and Hamas being broken. Polozooza ( talk ) 21:29, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Do you have a source for that? Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:30, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Sure I do. The first thing google gives me if I type in "gaza+attack+truce+hamas" is this one . Plenty of sources, both online and offline, can be found that mention these airstrikes as the direct reason for the truce to end. Polozooza ( talk ) 21:33, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Are you joking? i asked WP:RS, not "antiwar" blog. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:36, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
No jokes, just being lazy. ;) It was the first thing that showed up. There are plenty of other sources to be found. Polozooza ( talk ) 21:43, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
While you might be currently in some laziness state, i suggest you make notice of WP:SOAP and WP:OR rules in your free time. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:56, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
There are plenty out there, and im sure on that page too
Im neutral on this, though merging the two and changing the title would make 1 better article instead of 2 shitty ones. Alternatively, to satisfy two possible biases on such 1rr articles, we could paraphrase this on the section f the response on that article and "main" link it here.
Also not to sure that anti-war is the best source, but tehre are plenty Lihaas ( talk ) 21:32, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
With a little work, both articles could easily upgrade above the level "shitty". The other article isn't that bad, either. This one could be (and should be) just as good. The events described, and the results of these events, are certainly noteworthy. Polozooza ( talk ) 21:35, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Both articles seem perfectly justified. I see no reason to merge. Surely we can figure that out later if its appropriate. -- Eraserhead1 < talk > 22:04, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Indeed, and while this article is linked on many pages and on the Main Page, we should strive to expand it as much a possible and make it a proper article. All those templates don't look very nice for readers, I think. ;) Polozooza ( talk ) 22:07, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
I removed the orange tags as they didn't make any sense. -- Eraserhead1 < talk > 23:05, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
I also think this article should be merged into 2011 southern Israel attacks . קולנואני ( talk ) 22:37, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Support merger. קולנואני ( talk ) 21:53, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I think that the best solution would be to have two separate articles. Or take the Gaza raids information to the 2011 southern Israel attacks article as expansion. But until that is made properly I support two articles.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 22:44, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
The way the article stands this has more Gaza reaction to the attack and that has more of the other (which was dubious per ITN). i now strongly support a merge and name change to something like August 2011 Israel-Gaza militant tensions or August 2011 Israel-Gaza attacks ( Lihaas ( talk ) 23:33, 20 August 2011 (UTC)).
Support Move to sandbox or merge per WP:CFORK Wikifan
23:38, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Support merger. The two articles are strongly related. They can always be resplit. Metallurgist ( talk ) 23:38, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Most people dont seem to agree with the interpretation of fork, hnece consensus generating discussions
Metallurgist, whats the point in that? you havent explained.( Lihaas ( talk ) 00:01, 21 August 2011 (UTC)).
Oppose. They look like separate events in separate locations. One in the Aqaba gulf and one in Gaza. Nightw 01:34, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Seem like what? Everything is in this article is in the other one. It is 100% content fork, and arguably a POV one as well. I cannot believe it is being featured. Wikifan
02:32, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Merge. Definitely a content fork - the "background" in this article and the "aftermath" in the other mean they cover basically the same content, and the events cannot well be separated either. Also extremely likely (in this topic area) to become a POV fork. One query: what would the article be called? I don't think it's appropriate to treat Israel's retaliation merely as "aftermath," which we would be implying if we kept the current title of 2011 southern Israel attacks . Roscelese ( talk ⋅ contribs ) 03:38, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Lihaas's suggestion of "August 2011 Israel-Gaza attacks" seems good. Roscelese ( talk ⋅ contribs ) 03:45, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose merger. One side claims they're related, the other side claims they're not. Therefore per NPOV there is no reason to assume they are related. We simply mention that the Israeli government claims that they are related in both articles, which is sufficient to present their POV. Jim Sukwutput 05:54, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Support merger. Retaliation to an act of terrorism is not necessarily sufficient for an article of its own when it can be included in the Southern Israel attacks article as response. The air strikes clearly appear to be a response to what occurred near Eilat. This event would not have occurred otherwise.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 07:11, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose - just doing this for the record. My reasons are stated above in the discussion.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 08:44, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose - and would like to make a different suggestion: Imagine that this thing escalates into another round of Israeli-Gaza war. We then *should* one article on this "Nth Israeli-Gaza war", and one separate article on the the thing that started it all (the attack on the road). Just like we have separate articles for World War I and the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria which was the reason/excuse for this war. But, importantly, we cannot call the second article the "August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids", because then where will we write about the Hamas's retaliation to those, and Israel's 2nd retaliation, and Hamas's 3rd retaliation, and so on and so on? I suggest calling the second article something like August 2011 Gaza-Israel clashes, with the term "clashes" perhaps replaced by something else which the media will call this. Nyh ( talk ) 12:44, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I agree with Nyh. I wouldn't be strongly opposed to a merge if this conflict escalates and the succeeding attacks become more significant (i.e. outright warfare). But right now I don't see any rationale for a merger. Jim Sukwutput
Support merged article (with perhaps a different title) - both the the attacks in Israel and the subsequent air raids in Gaza did not take place in a vacuum, they took place within the broader context of ongoing Palestinian/Israeli attack and retaliation, and for the reader to understand this broader context, both sub-events should be discussed together. Blueboar ( talk ) 20:31, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
But if we take your logic to the extreme, there should only be one article for the seven-decade long conflict. Obviously that'd be silly, so there must be a point where we choose to split up a topic into several articles, right? Jim Sukwutput 20:43, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Comment. Now that 2011 southern Israel attacks has been renamed 2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks , I think it makes the case for a merge into that article even stronger because that title can encompass both the original terrorist attacks and the Israeli air strike into Gaza rendering the point of this article relatively useless by itself. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 21:50, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Merge. For the reasons stated above. Brmull ( talk ) 02:06, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose and Rename to 2011 Gaza - Israel conflict. Merger would result a synthesis of two distinct events. The two are related but not a single campaign. Reliable sources are not saying this is a single event. This would immensely confuse the readers. The current name of the article is also confusing, since it appears to document a one-sided attack rather than bidirectional warfare. Marokwitz ( talk ) 14:13, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Merge for the reasons stated above, also the information seem to be contained in one article without a big problem. 92.46.98.66 ( talk ) 17:58, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Merge as to the reason that Israel always attacks Gaza after they fire rockets and this time is not really that different or special to deserve an article. ( NamflNamfl ) 02:08, 23 August 2011 (UTC) — Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.138.89.253 ( talk )
Comment - due to conflicting renaming proposal this merge proposal is relisted on the noticeboard and due to be discussed according to standard procedures. The conflicting renaming is frozen until the merge voting is closed. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 18:08, 23 August 2011 (UTC)
Huh? What is going on now?-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 00:13, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
You made a conflicting proposal of renaming, while this merging proposal had still been standing, thus your proposal was also disrupting and might even be irrelevant if the merge dicussion outcome is merge. However, if the merging discussion is closed with keep, then we would go back to your renamal proposal. The usual timewindow for each proposal is one week, though it might vary, depending on specific circumstances. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 16:57, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
10 say to merge (~59%). 7 say not to merge (~41%). Does this mean there will be a merge? Israguy ( talk ) 01:04, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
It doesn't really work that way. I/P can be rather partisan so evaluating a discussion based on oppose/supports alone is dubious. As of RIGHT NOW, the article has nothing unique to separate it from the 2011 attacks in southern israel. Literally, virtually everything here - including the infobox - is in the article. A pure fork, POV or not. So if there is anything of worth to merge, fine - but the article needs to be taken down soon. Wikifan
05:36, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
Support merge - Unnecessary content fork, current article does nothing but rehash information already specified in the other. The raids follow and are a direct result of the southern Israel attack, whatever one may feel about Israel's choice of target. Even criticism of Israel's choice of attacking Gaza would be out of place in an article that divorces the raids from the attack that preceded it, when the criticism is centered on the identity of the attackers. Poliocretes ( talk ) 10:50, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
I believe the reasoning for merge is solid and grounded in policy. Only a few sentences would be merged in that case, because the rest of the article is copy-paste from the original article. Wikifan

21:26, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
my edits there were only in relation to what was there, whatever consensus decides is fine by me Lihaas ( talk ) 21:31, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Done, but the objective is synthesis as raids happened in aug 2011 even before the 18 Lihaas ( talk ) 21:39, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Oops. I changed it to a different template before reading this. I didn't think "operational" was appropriate. Honestly this article is unnecessary and IMO a fork. Title should be changed as well. Wikifan
21:48, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Title should be changed to what, exactly? And why is this a fork? Please elaborate. Polozooza ( talk ) 21:52, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
It's a fork of the original article. This is not an independent event, but part of the attacks on Israel prior. All the information here is already in the other article. That is the definition of a fork. Wikifan
23:37, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Thats the basis for this consensus generating debate and hence your opinion. doesnt mean you change things to what you prefer in the meantime while were discussing( Lihaas ( talk ) 23:59, 20 August 2011 (UTC)).
All the information were in the other article only because of your relentless POV-pushing and using the article as your political platform. The other users here are simply cleaning up the mess. Jim Sukwutput 05:47, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
me?( Lihaas ( talk ) 11:27, 21 August 2011 (UTC)).
And rightfully so; the article is linked on the Main Page, after all. Now the other article wasn't too perfect either - the lead was very, very dubious if I recall correctly. Polozooza ( talk ) 09:08, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
No, Lihaas, you've done a great job in this article. I was referring to Wikifan. Jim Sukwutput 12:55, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Is this really a reliable source? The notion that Israeli air attacks is motivated by inner turmoil seems quaint, to say the least. As is the idea that IDF capabilities would be affected by these attacks. Ketil ( talk ) 22:30, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Xinhua is a RS. Discussions as such should be at RSN. Lihaas ( talk ) 22:46, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
An editor continues to say civilian targets were attacked when one of the dead was a Chief Warrant Officer from yammam and "Another fatality was Staff Sgt. Moshe Naftali, 22, of the Israel Defense Forces' Golani Brigade." a bomb by an idf patrol is NOT civilian( Lihaas ( talk ) 23:20, 20 August 2011 (UTC)).
added sources et al to article and clarified both civilian and military targets.
Done?( Lihaas ( talk ) 23:30, 20 August 2011 (UTC)).
Beware of synthesis[ edit ]
Unless we can find a set of reliable sources that agree that separate retaliatory responses by Israel due to separate attacks by Palestinian militants are an single event ("August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids" or similar), then this entire article is a violation of WP:SYNTH . In particular, it's highly doubtful that the earlier Israeli response to a Beer Sheva rocket and the current Israeli response to the Eilat attacks should be considered a single event. Doing so seems to be a transparently POV attempt to make it look like Israel is "attacking" Gaza. It's well known that Israel retaliates in direct response to terrorist (or "militant" or whatever) attacks coming from Palestinians, but each of these needs to be kept strictly separate unless there is clear evidence from reliable sources of linkage. In this case I doubt the Aug 14 rocketing/response has anything to do with the Eilat attacks, esp. as the scope of the Aug 18 Eilat attacks suggests far more time was require to plan this thing than the 4 days between Aug 14 and Aug 18.
I would suggest deleting/merging this article because of this. Benwing ( talk ) 02:38, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
This article was created in response to concerns about an "in the news" item on the Main Page. That news item said Hamas cancelled the de facto truce due to "attacks on Gaza." This article was created as a target for a wikilnk from "attacks on Gaza" to explain what attacks Hamas was talking about. After this article got started, someone asked for citations about air attacks on Gaza in August 2011 that preceded the August 18 incident. Perhaps "synthesis" arises from the article title's mentioning August 2011. I agree the article should report Israel's claim that each air strike into Gaza was a response to a specific provocation. Sharktopus talk 03:27, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
this article shouldn't have been created to begin with. no articles should be created "in response" to other articles. it screams fork. Wikifan
Let's keep the discussion in one place, in this case Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates#.5BPosted.5D_Israel-Hamas_end_of_truce . Though it's a bit pointless as we already have overwhelming consensus, with only Wikifan dissenting. Jim Sukwutput 05:45, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I did not say this article was created "in response to another article." I said it was created in response to a Main Page problem with In the News. Just to give a bit more context, a few months ago ITN had a similar issue with an item about a frog previously thought extinct. ITN was pointing to an article about the frog in question. People complained the article was substandard; the ITN item vanished from the front page, the frog article was improved, the ITN item linking to it was reinstated. There is currently an item at ITN that originally said it was about "attacks on Gaza" but that linked to a (substandard) article about attacks on Israel. Now the ITN item links to both articles. Ultimately, the two articles will probably merge into a single article which will sadly be about a series of attacks, revenge-attacks, revenge-for-revenge-attacks, etc. in the Middle East and involving Israel, Gaza, and Egypt. But as Jim S points out, that discussion will happen somewhere else. Sharktopus talk 11:36, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
The article, as currently reads, is biased to the side of Hamas. The article clearly uses tones and words such as "according to the Israeli government" "for which they blamed the Popular Resistance Committees, who denied involvement.[1]" ". That incident was said to be retaliation for a Palestinian rocket that landed in Beersheba." "some of the alleged 20 perpetrators." "Defense Minister Ehud Barak accused the Popular Resistance Committees" I suggest that the article be re-worded to a more neutral tone as soon as convient. DEWY CHEATEM AND HOWE ( talk ) 05:40, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Which of these statements are not factually correct? Jim Sukwutput 05:42, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
ditto, itd be biased the other side if not. theyre all duly sourced on bnoth pages.( Lihaas ( talk ) 11:22, 21 August 2011 (UTC)).
What you're describing as bias looks like judicious attempts to avoid bias. How is using terms like "according to" (citing a source of a statement) or "alleged" (a term always used in news articles until proof of guilt is established) bias? 70.16.209.81 ( talk ) 15:25, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
A suicide bomber killed several Egyptian soldiers on the Egyptian side of the border with Israel near the Philadelphia Route crossing from where did they got this ? It's quite amusing.

I agree with the bias claims - these strikes were in response to the attack on Israeli civilian buses and a private car. They were not the cause of the end of the ceasefire but a response to an attack in which 8 civilians were murdered. User:yoni_bhonker
According to Israel, these strikes were in response to the attacks near Eilat. According to Hamas, these strikes were the motivation for ending the truce. Both statements should be reported and attributed by the article. Sharktopus talk 23:08, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
So you illegally crossed into Egypt and murdered 5 Egyptian soliders in response to attacks on "civilian" buses in your country by a group from another nation? Dig that hole, JIDF. Dig that hole. 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 13:38, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane
Requested Move to August 2011 Gaza Strip air strikes[ edit ]
The following discussion is an archived discussion of a requested move . Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on the talk page. No further edits should be made to this section.
The move request to "August 2011 Gaza Strip air attacks" was postponed, since it interrupted the ongoing merge proposal discussion. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:04, 23 August 2011 (UTC)
the name of this article and proposed move references "raids/strikes" while the one focusing on the israeli side references attacks. Is this npov? 71.180.64.181 ( talk ) 07:44, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Not necessarily. A raid is an attack. Both sides see them as attacks. If 2011 Gaza Strip air attacks then I'd be willing to consider that a possibility for the article name. I'd argue that raid is potentially not NPOV as it is. If strike is also seen by others as not being NPOV compliant, I think attack would be best.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 07:47, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Italicized text added in edit for clarification-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 07:49, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I think it's not npov and it should be changed to "attacks" to match Israeli article. 71.180.64.181 ( talk ) 07:58, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I'm going to withdraw this and re-propose with your suggestion for the most NPOV option.
weak oppose per WP article "Air raid refers to an attack by aircraft against ground or sea targets. The term is generally used for strategic bombing, while airstrike is used for smaller-scale tactical attacks." Its not small scale its strategic and much larger than the pre-=aug 18 strikes that preceded it. Although were getting somewhere in the merge proposal above (perhaps) so we should consolidate this there.( Lihaas ( talk ) 11:25, 21 August 2011 (UTC)).
Support. Article is fork from 2011 Attacks on southern israel. If a conflict mutates from that article - then one can be created. But right now this article is 100% linked to the original attacks. No original content in this article, none at all. Wikifan
12:21, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Let me note that Wikifan is supporting a merger, not a rename. He means oppose here. Jim Sukwutput 12:57, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Jim, and if that rename is unsuccessful for what ever reason? The title is clear POV. Lihaas, if you take a look at strategic bombing or total war two concepts linked to air raid you will see air raid is not a NPOV title. Air raids have a very specific meaning in the historical context. Once again, I must state that I prefer merge before move, but given the fact this is a current event swift actions are needed to clear up present NPOV violations.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 20:00, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I don't have an opinion about the article's title. All I'm pointing out is that Wikifan12345 appears to be confused in that he's actually supporting a merger, not a rename. Not sure if I misunderstood his comment. Jim Sukwutput 20:40, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Nevermind, I didn't quite understand what you meant. I thought Wikifan was supporting a merge yes, but also a rename should the merge fail, but you are right that was not necessarily clear. I think the best way to understand would be for Wikifan to state whatever he feels.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 20:46, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
What's the point of the move, if this article is going to be merged? קולנואני ( talk ) 21:56, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
No concensus on this merge has been reached yet. Both the move and the merge are still being discussed. On a side not: I myself am in favour of a move. The article should be renamed as "August 2011 Gaza Strip attacks". Polozooza ( talk ) 22:06, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Polozooza is correct. In the event that consensus is not reached on the merge, this move is the best way to address NPOV for all sides. I once again must reiterate my difference of opinion with Polozooza however regarding the preferred solution as I feel that a merge to the now renamed 2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks remains the best option.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 22:14, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
"August 2011 Gaza Strip attacks" Why? What ref supports such a title? The title is almost identical to the militant attacks on Israel. No media source is portraying Israel's response to attacks on its own borders as equivalent to the attack on Israeli civilians days before. The article should be merged, all the content here is found in the original article. We don't create articles for military responses to attacks on the Taliban every time they blow up a military or civilian outpost unless its a specific operation. And consensus is not about votes, policy takes precedence and lest we forget this article was created without consensus. Wikifan

RfC on Accuracy of Using Term "Air Raids"[ edit ]
I'm requesting an RfC at both Politics and History on whether air raid is appropriate terminology given its connection to strategic bombing and total war whereas the Gaza strip attacks seem to be carefully targeted strikes based on evidence originally provided and referenced in this article.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 20:16, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Carefully targeted? Sure. Still, the resulted in the death of several civilians, among whom a child. The people killed in Eilat where also "carefully targeted" and the attacks "organised". So why not call it an attack aswell, like that article? Whether it be by land, water or air, an attack is an attack is an attack. Polozooza ( talk ) 20:56, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I'm curious why the front page says "Israel responds to attacks in southern Israel with air strikes on the Gaza Strip." it was Israel who attacked Gaza first with airstrikes, which killed seven civilians one being a child. As we know, """Hamas was not responsible for the attack""", and therefore Israels attack was unprovoked. The front page should read "Gaza responds to airstrikes in Gaza with rocket fire directed at surrounding Israeli cities".
The front page headline is very misleading and I hope it is changed soon.
Here is the timeline of events:
12:00 pm August 18, 2011 A group of armed militants cross the southern Egyptian border into Israel near the city of Eilat.
12:40 pm August 18, 2011 The 3rd phase of the militants operation is commenced with rocket fire from Egypt.
13:30 pm August 18, 2011 Another attack on a Israeli convoy is staged on the Egyptian-Israeli border, killing 4 civilians.five.
hours after* Israeli soldiers clashed with the militants along the Egyptian-Israeli border, killing 5 Egyptian policemen.
Israel then launched retaliation air raids against the Hamas run Gaza Strip killing four plus a child.
With rocket fire in response to the airstrikes.
It's all in the link, from your very own:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/August_2011_Gaza_Strip_air_raids — Preceding unsigned comment added by 74.72.4.168 ( talk ) 21:05, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
You're reading the sources wrong. The attacks occurred on Thursday morning, Israel responded after subduing the original militants in a fire-fight. the child (age has said to be 2 or 12) was the son/daughter of a PRC militant. And as far as Israel is concerned, Hamas is responsible for governing Gaza and thus any attacks originating from it is the fault of Hamas. No international organization has disputed this, nor Has Hamas rejected their control over Gaza which they see as legitimate. Wikifan

Neutral. I don't see a significant difference between "attacks" and "raids". I do however support the merge. Recent events articles get forked way too much, which wastes editors' time, doesn't improve wikipedia, and it's hard as hell to remove even stupid ones later on. Brmull ( talk ) 02:25, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Rename to "2011 Gaza - Israel conflict". This article is about a two sided conflict, not "air raids". Marokwitz ( talk ) 14:19, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Hmm, not a bad idea and neutral too. then we can merge both. Lihaas ( talk ) 20:36, 23 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose rename as this has not been described as an all-out conflict or war. Recent news suggest Israeli government is about to enter an informal cease-fire with Hamas. Unless an actual operation takes place we can't call it a conflict any less than we can call the various spats in Afghanistan/Iraq unique "conflicts." Wikifan
00:13, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
Israeli government is not negotiating with Hamas. Hamas declared a cease-fire, but rockets are still being fired at Israeli cities and towns. Israeli schools and synagogues are destroyed. a 9 months old baby was hospitalized. If this is not an armed conflict - I don't know what IS. Israguy ( talk ) 01:10, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
Rename article name[ edit ]
The current name "August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids" is bias, since it is not clear from this name that the raid is a retaliation for murders of Israelis on Israeli land. Also - not only Gaza is under attack. Beer Sheva , Askelon , Ashdod , Sderot , Netivot and other southern towns of Israel are under attack - just not by "air raid", but "only" by rockets and missles launched from the ground. Name of article should be less bias and more neutral. Israguy ( talk ) 00:55, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
How is this not clear? The very first sentence mentions that the attacks were declared as "retaliation" by the Israeli state, with a helpful link to that article. Jim Sukwutput 08:05, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
Fully agree with you Israguy. We are not alone in this view.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 06:24, 26 August 2011 (UTC)
Copy-pasted from my section on this talk page: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Talk:2011_southern_Israel_cross-border_attacks
Some parts of the article state the nationality of the attackers as Palestinian, based on sources which claim the attackers were members of the Popular Resistance Committees. This is a disputed fact, as the PRC denies involvement, and there are verifiable sources showing that: http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?ID=234512&R=R1
I have amended some parts of the article which state Palestinian nationality, based on claims of PRC membership, and it would be good to see more discussion about and critical analysis of sources which make these claims. Arfed ( talk ) 15:57, 25 August 2011 (UTC)

Eilat? it happend in south Israel not far from Eilat (not IN), and near the egyptian border... -- Max ( talk ) 17:07 GMT+, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Fair enough but this article is rubbish and not per MOS and not to mention pov per WTA. How about 2011 southern Israel attacks , if there is another one then we can add th emonth/date. (weve done that before for new delhi in 2008. Lihaas ( talk ) 14:16, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
OK, but just let merge this article into the other one. Because this one is actually rubbish while the other one is on the event and updated.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 14:37, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Problem now. the same title with a capital s and lower case s links to the 2 different pages. Proper term is lower case s as its not a proper noun, but the content at capital s is better.
for gods sake what the heck is going on! Theres no consensus at all for this new incarnation since there were THREE attacks at various places. Lihaas ( talk ) 15:00, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Agree with Lihaas lets merge this article into the 2011 Southern Israel attacks article and move the name 2011 Ein Netafim attacks with it. Easy and best way of solving this.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 15:07, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
It appears that there is disagreement about the title and some confusion on how to solve the disagreement. Therefore, I am opening a discussion. Personally I feel that since there is no official name, and the location of the attacks is called Ein Netafim, the title 2011 Ein Netafim attacks should stay (there was another attack in the same location many years ago, if anyone's interested). If you dispute this, please discuss here. I am going to be out for the next few hours. — Ynhockey ( Talk ) 15:02, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
I agree with you on the name. and that the content from this article should be merged into the 2011 Southern Israel attacks and the name 2011 Ein Netafim attacks be moved to that article.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 15:06, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
per below as well there was no consensus ont he move, thre were MULTIPLE attacks several km from each other. southern with a lower case is better. Lihaas ( talk ) 15:13, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
There were no consensus to move 2011 Southern Israel attacks article into this one.... but anyway its done. But I found the other article to be better.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 15:10, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Because the article covers all three attacks, in my opinion it is better to change the name of the article to 2011 Southern Israel attacks . TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 15:20, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
We seem to have clear consensus on this one. Though may i add 2011 southern Israel attacks . I dont believe "Southern Israel" is a proper noun or official part of teh province or something, its the generic region. Lihaas ( talk ) 15:31, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Yes lihaas is right change it back to 2011 southern Israel attacks spelling, and merge.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 15:44, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Regardless of the name, it was a waste of effort to maintain two different articles. The name can be settled later, I've redirected the other article here so that contributions don't go to waste on parallel articles. Poliocretes ( talk ) 16:44, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
No one is saying that we need to maintain two separate articles - apparently the two articles were created without their authors being aware that they have created duplicate articles. Anyway, what in your opinion is the most appropriate name for this article? TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 16:53, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
I have moved the article to what appears to be the consensus version, even though I disagree with it—it's not as descriptive as the other title, while being the same length. In any case, let's tie up all the loose ends in the article because there were 3 simultaneous articles created and they were slowly merged, but some confusion still exists about the different ones. For now I'll go over all the redirects and see. — Ynhockey ( Talk ) 17:18, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
In my opinion, we need to find a better name in order to distinguish this specific event from the many frequent rocket attacks that have been fired by Palestinian militants at Israeli targets in the southern part of Israel during 2011. Any suggestions? TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 20:07, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
I think the 2 noms above are a little vague at the moment tille more details emerge 8(first) and pov/wta (second).
it seems both attacks occurred miles apart to say that they were at just 1 place of the border crossing is deceptive on the third attack. Eilat (which was the original name) seemed good to me, but more details from others emerged that it was outside eilat. Lihaas ( talk ) 20:41, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
What the heck is a "militant"? Are IDF members militants? I think guerilla is probably the best term.

I have a suggestion... 2011 Ein Netafim attacks . I really don't understand the opposition to this proposal. — Ynhockey ( Talk ) 21:06, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
2011 Ein Netafim attacks is not a bad suggestion at all, but in my opinion, 2011 coordinated guerrilla attacks in southern Israel or 2011 joint guerrilla attacks in southern Israel would work better because the attacks took place out in the wilderness nearby the highway and didn't occur in one specific spot/village/town. What is the most common name/s this event has received in the media? (please specify your sources). TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 21:50, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
But all attacks are not at Ein Netafim, and we dont even have a blue lijnk for it. Lihaas ( talk ) 22:02, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
As far as I know, all the attacks took place in that area. Do you have a more precise map of the attacks? (the current coordinates in the article seem wrong too). — Ynhockey ( Talk ) 23:04, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
I dont, thats why im asking. not sure what the wider Ein Netafim is. I thought it was generally Eilat. (nice airport, in the heart of the city though id say its quite unsecured. and that ol' russiahn plane parked off to look at ;) Nice swim though, but how does security work at the beach by the Jordan border? Missing 3 MOnkeys..;)) Lihaas ( talk ) 23:11, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
How about:
I don't understand why editors manage to remove whole sentences of information, merge unrelated content into ambiguous section titles, and then get away with it.
These kinds of heavy, unilateral edits require consensus. Also, this edit is not line with policy . The source explicitly describes the acts as "terror." It is not the viewpoint of the author, it comes from a reliable source. Guideline: "may express contentious opinion and are best avoided unless widely used by reliable sources to describe the subject, in which case use in-text attribution." Also, - not a policy. No shame in using the T word at 2011 Norway attacks so why can't it be used here?
This edit isn't even supported by the source. And this is SYNTH as the source does not mention the The Popular Resistance Committees nor does the source explicitly dispute claims that the perps were in fact PRC members. So again editors are inserting their own views in the article and it shows. I've already used up my 1 revert but I think Lihaas has made at least 6 in the last 24 hours which is sanctionable. Wikifan
22:01, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Oh for the love of god, inm not revertign anything. Im adding content and sources and explaining everything,. At any rate, also comment on CONTENT. the edit conflicts that i happen to overwrite and readded back (take for example the edit that updated 8 deaths, etc)
to explain the edits, the reorg of the section (which is NOT a revert of anything but an original edit) is in line organising content as per other attacks artickes when some sections are nothing but 1 line and unsourced at that. Look at the first link and youll see missing fact tags.
Swarm's edit is right (and it has nothign to do with me) as we dont copy word-for-word from sources, this is not a news service to parrot the media. WTA explicitly says not to use such controversial words unless in quotes. (for which those in the reactions that call it so are duly mentioned)
the original al jazeera page mentioned the soldiers on board heading to eilat, they must have changed the bit. often they change stuff keeping the sdame link. probs we can remove that then. It is in the source, i just read it. "soldiers on their way home from their respective bases for the weekend."
Per PRC see the next section (ill go and tag the source there, there was a jpost source that said so)
Done Lihaas ( talk ) 22:08, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Lihaas, adding content is one thing - removing content (and their sources) counts as a revert. Compare the first version to the second. ARBPIA is firm on 1rr per 24 hours to prevent issues like this from arising. Swarm's edit is disputable because the link he cites as a reason is a guideline, not a policy, and the guideline explicitly says go with what the sources say. Norway attack are described as terror in nature in the very first sentence. I encourage you self-revert and restore one of the earlier versions of the article. Wikifan
22:19, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
What content and sources did i remove? Tell me and ill more than happily avoid this sort of conflict by reverting my edit. I dont think a blanket revert of an entire version would help as it will remove a LOT of other stuff. But if you tell me what i rvted, i will surely self-rvt the controversy.
Norway attack sholdnt say that and ought to be changed. Lihaas ( talk ) 22:28, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Okay Lihaas, I'm going to be as brief and concise as possible.
this needs to go . None of the sources are suggesting a conflict of who is responsible for this attack. Just because a source doesn't mention a guilty party does not mean they oppose sources that previously stated the perps. Get it? It's call synthesis. Understand it. Breath it. Get it. I see this all the time on Israeli-related articles. Unless an RS says, specifically, "while x said these guys did it, y has yet to confirm said journalism blah blah." We as editors cannot ASSUME this , even if it might be true. Wikifan
23:32, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Firstly; refrain from NPA you comment on CONTENT "Understand it. Breath it. Get it." Secondly how is that a revert? what was reverted in adding a NEW section per WP:BOLD .
How is it then synthesis to cite EXACTLY WHAT IS IN THE SOURCES that security services pblamed PRC. Especially since the infoboxmentions it without a word of prose in the article. That is okay and not synthesis?
See Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates#Attack_in_Israel for more and more sources that OTHER editors too have said dont attribute claims. Lihaas ( talk ) 23:40, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
BE BOLD is something not to be used at I/P articles. Editors are limited 1 RR per 24 hours and are expected to gain a consensus or at least explain large removal or expansion of edits made unilaterally in discussion.
I'm looking at the sources, none of them cite a conflict between x source saying PRC is guilty but b source saying "no, that hasn't been confirmed yet."
I'll even post the sources for you.
Im nost sure if Clinton should come before or after the State Depts reaction. What do others think? is the minister or ministry more important? (which per Yes Minister is mostly civil servants who apparently know more)
Also to explain my reorg per a statement above: i tried to be more neutral in the reactions by saying "regional" instead of involved as we dont yet know for sure whos involved. Lihaas ( talk ) 22:25, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Well in the US, the reaction of the actual Secretary is the most important.

Unexplained and dubuious edit summary by an admin here. The addition was duly noted in the edit summary and explained, this is vandalism if there was one.
Added on the premiuse that its multiple attacks in a city by non-state actors and hence clearly similar, at least without consensus or explanation fo removal. Lihaas ( talk ) 23:51, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
I agree. Also, "don't be ridiculous" is rather offensive. Suggesting the event is somehow less tragic than the attacks on India. I'm not familiar with the "see also" policy. The only editor-related issue I have is the "don't be ridiculous" which is totally offensive. Wikifan

While the edit summary is not appropriate, the removal is hardly vandalism : "a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia". In addition, I think that the removal is justified unless a reliable source makes the connection; else, the claim that both events were "multiple attacks in a city by non-state actors and hence clearly similar" is an original conclusion . -- Black Falcon ( talk ) 19:42, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Is this article going to be part of a potentially greater conflict? three injured by rocket . It seems as though the original attacks have led to further engagements, yet all appear to be connected to the first attack. Suggestions? Wikifan
03:30, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
This is part of a conflict that has been ongoing for at minimum the past 70 years. There are reactions to reactions to reactions to reactions. So, I'd say let's be a bit conservative here in limiting the scope to what's actually relevant to the attack. I suggest cutting it off at "Israeli retaliation". -- Bob drobbs ( talk ) 18:15, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
This Jerusalem Post Article appear to conflict with this BBC News Article . The BBC Article reports the Egyptian policemen were shot by Israeli forces however it's not confirmed by Israel but they've starting an inquiry whereas an Israeli news station reports that Palestinian suicide bombers killed the Egyptian policemen. According to the BBC article Egypt claims they were shot by Israel however Israeli news says they were killed by Palestinians. I can't make sense of whether on not this is biased Israeli news or not. If I'm confusing two separate events then sorry and please correct me on this, I won't edit the article unless someone else will confirm these are the same event.

You can't make sense of whether or not this is biased BBC news or not, either. Pedantrician ( talk ) 20:25, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Israeli news says that Israeli forces were shot upon, near the Israel-Egypt border. The Israeli forces shot back, towards the origin of the fire that was shot at them. It seems that the terrorists located themselves very close to an Egyptian post, and therefor Egyptian policemen were shot, when the Israeli force returened fire. But nothing is 100% confirmed yet. קולנואני ( talk ) 20:05, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
They now have their own article: August 2011 Gaza Attack . Makes things a lot easier, I'd say. It is these retaliations, after all, that resulted in Hamas calling off the truce. I would be very glad if some of the editors of this article would be willing to help expand the new article. Some of them have already contributed. Thanks already! Polozooza ( talk ) 20:11, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
I'm not sure this is a good idea. Israel was attacked by Palestinians. Israel retaliated, and after that - the Palestinians will also retaliate, which will cause Israel to retaliate again, and who knows when this will end. So, what's the point in spliting these articles? קולנואני ( talk ) 22:35, 20 August 2011 (UTC)

Uh, Israel broke the ceasefire. It's amazing how many times you JIDF think Israel breaking a truce and then being counter-attacked makes the guys who retaliated to be "the ones who broke the truce". It's like Israel is some guy repeatedly punching some other guy in the face and then starts raging about getting revenge for that "unprovoked attack" when he finally punches back...but with an entire nation and nukes. It's pathetic and it's sad you JIDF even think anyone is buying it despite your desperate attempts to troll any responses away. 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 13:42, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane
In what sense is Hamas breaking a "defacto truce"--rocket attacks into Israel from the Gaza Strip have never ceased.

In the sense that some/most/all (not sure) of the rockets fired from Gaza to Israel were not fired by Hamas itself, but by other terror organizations. קולנואני ( talk ) 22:46, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
In the sense that Hamas and its apologists claim to be the elected government of Gaza, and expect to be granted legitimacy as such when dealing with the international community, they can't suddenly claim to be just one many terrorist gangs when it suits them. Pedantrician ( talk ) 20:00, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
How is that undue? There is nothing undue about including fatalities of those killed. There were no "corresponding" Palestinian victims, in the sense of Israelis being killed in cold-blood while Palestinians were killed as Israeli bombed militant targets in Gaza.
Plenty of other articles involve fatality lists. I suggest a self-revert, I'm not sure if I can restore it as I may have used up my 1rr in the last 24hrs. Wikifan
One killed in Beersheva by a Grad[ edit ]
Gaza terrorists bombarded cities in Israel's southern region Saturday night. One person was killed when a Grad rocket hit Be'er Sheva, and another two were critically wounded. Four others were wounded as well, and are in serious-to-moderate condition. [1]
Is "bombarded" the right word the use? They did not use bombs, but fired long range missles. Israguy ( talk ) 05:08, 21 August 2011 (UTC)

bombardedpast participle, past tense of bom·bard (Verb) 1. Attack (a place or person) continuously with bombs, shells, or other missiles: "the city was bombarded by federal forces"

Moved section on 'Other Attacks'[ edit ]
It clearly belongs further down in the chronology. Placing it before the Israeli Air Strike section is misleading, as it would seem to suggest that it was also involved in precipitating those Israeli attacks. 174.91.156.71 ( talk ) 01:08, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
POV problem with Jerusalem Post as a source about these attacks[ edit ]
This article should be based on news sources that distinguish between partisan claims and established fact. Instead, a plurality of its references come from a single right-wing source, the Jerusalem Post . These Jerusalem Post references parrot the Israeli government claim (that the PRC was responsible for the attacks) as if it were established fact.
"... the Popular Resistance Committees, the organization who orchestrated the terror attacks near Eilat on Thursday that left eight people dead. " [2]
"...Israel’s response to the terror attacks from the Sinai Peninsula came swiftly Thursday evening when the Israel Air Force bombed the southern Gaza Strip, killing the leadership of the Popular Resistance Committee (PRC), who had orchestrated the attacks." [3]
We don't yet know who was responsible, and the PRC has denied being involved. Articles that claim otherwise are opinion pieces, not WP:RS news stories. Sharktopus talk 01:56, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Jerusalem Post is an RS. As it stands the article does not say the PRC is responsible, but quotes the views of the IDF, Hamas, PRC (denied), etc. It's not that we don't know who is responsible - it's that other news organizations are slower to respond. This is a regional event, so of course native sources will jump to conclusions faster as information arrives. And the Israeli gov. is just as reliable as the USA/Canada. US news routinely accepts the claims of NATO without challenge. Wikifan
02:28, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
The New York Times in a RS, but we do not treat opinion pieces in the NYT as reliable sources on matters of fact. I don't think Wikipedia should treat US/Canada/NATO/Israel claims as established fact when those claims are seriously disputed. Sharktopus talk 02:39, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Editorials are an entirely different matter. What op-ed concerns you? I don't see any cited here. Wikifan
08:35, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
The two JP items I linked to above, both with the byline of "Yaakov Katz," cross the line from news to opinion when they both claim as established fact that Eilat attacks were by the PRC. Sharktopus talk 11:03, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
No, they didn't "cross the line." Jerusalem Post is an RS, the sources you link are not editorials.
11:30, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Oh come now, JPost isn't right-wing, and definitely not right-wing to the point of not being an RS (that distinction belongs to Arutz Sheva ). Though, we could still broaden our sources. Western media is still reporting on this, as shown by the NY Times article I linked further down on the Talk, so we could use some of those. We could also use YNet and HaAretz as well. Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie | Say Shalom! 12:55, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Is there an ironclad definition somewhere on Wikipedia of what constitutes a RS? The definitions that I've found seem to make it situational: it depends on whether the editor du jour approves of what the source is saying.. If I were defining it, I would include such criteria as, does the source include both sides of the issue and quote opposing views fairly and accurately. By these criteria, Arutz Sheva passes the test. If it is disqualified simply because it is right wing (i.e., it reports on stories that the rest of the media would just as soon the public know nothing about), then of course it fails. But it beats me why CNN, which openly admitted that it was faking the news from Iraq to please Saddam Hussein, the BBC, whose Arab reporters in Gaza openly declare that they see their reportage as part of the Palestinian struggle against Israel, the New York Times, which displays photos of bloodied Jews on the front page but calls them Arabs, Reuters, who happily accept Photoshopped images until caught, or Ha'Aretz, which does not present anything but the left wing side of the issue, are all unquestioned RS. I believe even Al Jazeera is an RS, no? They obviously have a political agenda, but of course they aren't labeled classic right wing (and Arutz Sheva even quotes them fairly, by the way. Pedantrician ( talk ) 18:51, 23 August 2011 (UTC)
Doesn't it seem to you that an article based largely upon a single source is a problem? Especially when somebody points out at least a few cases where that source has conflated opinion with news, failing to identify disputed points? I may well be in error calling it right-wing, based on what I read in Jerusalem Post . Sharktopus talk 13:09, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
There are 80 sources cited which is very respectable, and JP is definitely not a "right wing" source. If you have POV or factual accuracy concerns about specific facts, we can discuss them individually. Marokwitz ( talk ) 13:40, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
At the time I first expressed this concern, the article had 57 references, a respectable number; more than 20 of those references went to articles in the J Post, which I thought was a problem. The article is much better now than it was a few days ago. I have identified a couple of problems with a couple of J Post articles in this thread, purely wrt their asserting as "fact" a disputed claim that the PRC was responsible for Eilat attacks. Maybe they were, but international media RS have not asserted that connection as a fact. Sharktopus talk 14:28, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Article Name Problem[ edit ]
There's a problem with the name as is. As I understand it, this article is about the series of 3 attacks which happened in immediate succession a few days ago. Is that right?
However, the article title makes it sound like it should include each and every attack in Southern Israel from all of 2011.
Does anyone have a suggestion for a better name? -- Bob drobbs ( talk ) 03:12, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
There is no need to change the name of this article. South Israel is under attack. The series of 3 attacks were only the beggining. Israguy ( talk ) 05:31, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Indeed, there are still rockets being fired into the South. It's even still being reported in the New York Times, amazingly enough. [4] O_O Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie | Say Shalom! 12:30, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
"(though Hamas had never actually ceased rocket attacks into Israel)"
On the surface this appears to be editorializing. Our very own article Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel itself indicates that such rocket attacks occurred between 2001 and 2009, suggesting that they in fact were significantly diminished. The article goes on to indicate that in 2010 and 2011 there were a number of rocket attacks, but much fewer than before. The editorial parenthetical appears to dismiss this nuance. -x
The relatively non-existant Hamas ceasefire that the article seems to quote appears to be Israelis unilateral ceasefire (link) . The article at the start of the so called ceasefire shows that Israel intended to take indefinite action but Hamas was only limiting it to a week. And while the attacks may have died down, they by no means stopped. Truce does not mean a reduction in violence, it means ceaseation. Just because the media used a word does not mean the definition is being used correctly, and just because the other article in question seems not to cover 2010 and 2011 does not mean that a ceasefire occurred. I'd argue that article is incomplete and out of date.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 07:06, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Hamas stopped firing rockets themselves, but certain factions like Islamic Jihad managed to fire between one and five rockets a month. There was even a two month period without rockets and Hamas said they were cracking down on the various factions within Gaza to make them stop (which they were apparently.

In which section should have include the part that mentions the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers?[ edit ]
Were the 5 Egyptian soldiers killed during the period of the original series of attacks (roughly between 12:00 - 18:00 pm) or were they killed after the original series of attacks? If they were killed during the initial series of attacks - we must move the part which covers the their death to the "The attacks" section instead of the "Israeli retaliation" section in which this section is currently in. TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 17:20, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Since I'm already at 1RR, I have placed a POV tag on the article due to CuriousGnome's removal - or rather I should say selective removal, of Palestinian casualties from the infobox. I believe it is sophistry to pretend that this article and its accompanying infobox pertain only to the initial attack, when an entire section of the article is devoted to Israeli retaliations and rightly so. The fact that Gnome (and now Wikifan) have retained only the militant casualties from the Israeli airstrikes makes these edits all the more indefensible. I appeal to the editors in question to restore the full casualty figures. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:09, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Wait, don't mix my edits with CuriousGnome. I did not "retain" only militant casualties. However IMO the infobox should only include casualties from the original attacks. Any Palestinians militants/civilians killed later shouldn't be in the infobox. It confuses the reader. Wikifan
16:14, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Well then, could you at least remove the (+7 attackers) from the infobox? I still don't agree with the reasoning, but you (or gnome) can't have it both ways, either all the Palestinian casualties should be included or none. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:21, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Information regarding the Palestinians killed during the actual series of cross-border terror attacks and following battle which brought an end to the August 18th cross-border attacks is currently included in the infobox which covers the actual series of cross-border terror attacks and following battle which brought an end to the August 18th cross-border attacks (the infobox has been moved to the section of the article which covers this event to prevent confusion). This infobox should not contain additional information related to the subsequent events that took place in the following hours and/or days. If do you think that there are still errors in the information that appears in infobox, please state these errors in an objective and civil manner, and we will fix the infobox in order for it to reflect the reality objectively. TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 16:22, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
In my opinion, we can certainly consider, as a balanced approach, to add an additional infobox in the "Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip" section which would contain data relating to these subsequent events. What do you think of this compromise proposal? TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 16:28, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
It's better than nothing. We may have to address the larger issue at some stage however. BTW, I think your infobox casualty figures are out in any case, I count only six militants killed in the initial attacks, four by Israel and two by Egypt, but the infobox currently indicates a total of nine. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:30, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Too many infoboxes. Assuming the other article remains, explicit information about Palestinian deaths and a unique infobox should be moved there. I added an infobox to that article when it was first created but someone removed it. Wikifan
16:35, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
The other article should probably be merged with this one, they are obviously covering the same event. And "too many infoboxes" may not be ideal, but it's certainly a good deal better than a single infobox that covers only half the casualties. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:45, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
I'm not terribly happy with the fact that Gnome has employed a different infobox for the Israeli airstrikes, but as I indicated earlier, this seems to be a problem related to the limitations of the "civilian attack" infobox. We may have to take a closer look at that issue at some stage. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:59, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
I agree with Gatoclass that an additional template is needed mainly due to the sensitivity of the subject and as a current more balanced approach. For this reason, and because in this current discussion this is the decision of the majority, I took the liberty of adding a new template to the "Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip" section (Gatoclass - if you now object to the use of this template I will remove it immediately). Nevertheless, in my opinion, in the distant future when we would be able to see the whole event and subsequent events in a better perspective, we can definitely considered, based on the decision of the majority in the discussion page of course, summarizing the "Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip" section and having the infobox appear only in the August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids article. TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 17:03, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
As I said CuriousGnome, I am not entirely happy with the infobox you added, but I think if you cleared the "partof" field it would be more acceptable. It looks very odd to me to have Israeli strikes categorized as "part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict" while the Palestinian attacks that preceded and followed are not so categorized. But as a compromise, if you would agree to clear the field in question, I could probably agree to removing the pov tag. Gatoclass ( talk ) 17:07, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
I've added the "Part of Israeli–Palestinian conflict" section to the infobox of the attack. Does this seem as an acceptable compromise to you? TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 17:17, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Okay, that seems reasonable. I've removed the POV tag. Gatoclass ( talk ) 17:50, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
The lead says that the perpetrators are assumed to be Palestinian while the infobox says flat out that they are. However, Egyptian authorities say that they have identified three of the people responsible and that at least one of them is based in Sinai (see here ). As such, I am removing the infobox line.

Wait a second, why is al-Masry al-Youm not a reliable source? It is a major news source in Egypt, you cant simply dismiss sources you dislike. The source says that one of them men is the head of a Sinai based "terrorist cell", not from Gaza.
nableezy - 01:19, 24 August 2011 (UTC)

You just assumed it was why? Because it isnt Israeli or American? The al-Masry al-Youm source contradicts the claim that they were Palestinian. You cant just accept the Israeli narrative as gospel truth and claim any Arab source must be unreliable.
nableezy - 15:52, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
And to alleviate your concern with using an Egyptian source, an Israeli one repeats the report al-Masry al-Youm and says three of the attackers were Egyptian. Though the article currently goes further than the source (Ill correct that shortly).
nableezy - 15:54, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
The "fatalities" section also refers to "Palestinian militants". I'm concerned about such statements. If no-one has taken responsibility for the attacks, then we can't be sure the attackers were Palestinian. They may, for example, have been indigenous Egyptians allied with AQ or another radical group. I think it would be appropriate if the article ceased to refer to the attackers as "Palestinian" as if their identity were known with certainty. Gatoclass ( talk ) 04:47, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
Gato, you know better than this. Wikipedia is all about verifiability. Everyone in this section are Palestinians. They attackers may been from mars, right now we just go with what sources say. CNN cite above lists Palestinian militants without citing Israel/Egypt/other sources, so either that is their own independent reportage or something else. Some say Gaza-based al qaeda affliate . No source has suggested any "indigenous Egyptians" of being complicit in this incident. Wikifan
05:02, 24 August 2011 (UTC)

Personal column? That's the furthest from the truth you can get. Xinhua is actually the official news agency of the People's Republic of China. They have a POV of course with respect to issues in China, but on international issues they tend to rely on international sources. They're fast and have the most detailed information, which is why they get used so frequently on recent events articles. As for reliability, the community has previously decided that Xinhua would be a RS regardless of content, unless specifically for contentious issues in China. Jim Sukwutput 22:23, 27 August 2011 (UTC)
Some parts of the article state the nationality of the attackers as Palestinian, based on sources which claim the attackers were members of the Popular Resistance Committees. This is a disputed fact, as the PRC denies involvement, and there are verifiable sources showing that: http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?ID=234512&R=R1
I have amended some parts of the article which state Palestinian nationality, based on claims of PRC membership, and it would be good to see more discussion about and critical analysis of sources which make these claims.
Someone cited this article, which casts doubts on PRC origin of militants: http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/doubts-emerge-over-identity-of-terrorists-who-carried-out-attack-in-israel-s-south-1.380525 Arfed ( talk ) 13:56, 26 August 2011 (UTC)

Despicable pictures of a DIFFERENT attack[ edit ]
I see Israel is out in full force trying to make itself look like the victim again. Even IF there is a legitimate argument for including the incident Israel claims began their murder of 5 Egyptian soldiers, the pictures have absolutely no place. It is a sub-section of an article unrelated to that sub-section, PICTURES of the cars attacked from a DIFFERENT incident have no place here. It's a clear, deliberate attempt to push a Pro-Israel justification POV. They must be deleted at once. 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 13:50, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane

Have you actually READ the article? The incident begun with an attack on Israel, which the photos depict. I will now reinstate the photos, and if you don't like it, feel free to report me. Poliocretes ( talk ) 14:10, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
Which is ALREADY COVERED. But nice try. Those photos relate in no way to this article. Just as pictures of every person killed being posted relates in no way to this article. If those pictures are in sources then they are represented to required amount. Desperately trying to display photos to garner sympathy for Israel in an article about Israel's attack on Egypt, when Egypt played no part in those bus attacks, is not allowed.
So, again, I point out to you that those pictures are not allowed to be posted. They are POV and POV relating to ANOTHER attack, not this articles head-line. That one incident caused another is already covered. Pointless information regarding the other attack has NO place in an article devoted to the attack on Egypt.
And I say again...present a reason why pictures of cars (which do not display anything in relation to the article other than pitiful shock value) and a BUS THAT HAS BEEN EGGED relate in ANY way to THIS article and incident? Pictures are reinstated and you will be reported if you continue to ignore Wikipedias rules. 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 14:15, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane

IP, Egged is the name of the Israeli national bus company, it's not a bus that has been egged. You're completely out of your depth and better stop. Poliocretes ( talk ) 14:21, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
LOL. Marokwitz ( talk ) 14:25, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
Lol at the fact you think a buses company name is a reason for it to be included.
facepalm*
Pictures of a spood found near the site doesn't need its own picture either. Nor would it be allowed to post pictures of those Egyptians murdered by Israel. The latter being part of the direct subject of this article (Israel's attack that crossed into Egypt) and still not allowed. So no, a sub-section relating to a different incident isn't allowed to include pictures already covered in detail by multiple sources. Try again. 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 14:32, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane
Please point out the wikipedia policy guidelines that support the above assertions. You seem to be suffering an extreme case of WP:IJUSTDONTLIKEIT . Oh, and what you're doing on WikiProject Egypt is called WP:CANVASSING , and accusing seasoned editors of being sock puppets is a sure way of getting blocked. Poliocretes ( talk ) 15:15, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
I think the infobox to be used should be "Template:Infobox military conflict" as during the latter part of the attack a firefight broke out between the Egyptians and Israelis and several Egyptian soldiers were killed. This was not a simple civilian attack. VR talk 04:48, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
This is
(a)denied by spokesmen for those committees in the lead itself. So we have two versions, the IDF's and the PRC's.
(b) The source for the line makes no such claim (note 2)
(c) googling rapidly, I see that several sources, one a blog though hosted by Tikkun Olam, assert that the IDF's own enquiry concluded no Gazans were involved.
Max Blumenthal says this has been disproved.
Edited Egyptian Protests section[ edit ]
The last line of the original text showed gloating from whoever put it in. Some evidence of this is the reference of the article for Million-man demonstration being an Egyptian news site, while the other about being only "a few hundred" is an Israeli one. If you want to edit it back to the original please reply to me here with your reasons & why I'm wrong. Thank you. StoneCold45 ( talk ) 17:58, 19 March 2013 (UTC)
I changed the sentence. "Instead" instead of "only" didn't make it or the grammar any better, Ajnem ( talk ) 07:47, 19 March 2013 (UTC)
Thank you, couldn't have made it any better myself. StoneCold45 ( talk ) 17:58, 19 March 2013 (UTC)
You're welcome. Ajnem ( talk ) 17:01, 20 March 2013 (UTC)

This article has recently been created in order to cover the Gaza arena of the 2011 southern Israel attacks . It seems there might be a problem covering the Gaza arena as a WP:DUE event, outside the context of the southern Israel attacks, as well as WP:RS relation to this arena as such. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:26, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
These attacks deserve an article of their own, not just a small section within an already excisting article. These attacks are notable - they led to truce between Israel and Hamas being broken. Polozooza ( talk ) 21:29, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Do you have a source for that? Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:30, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Sure I do. The first thing google gives me if I type in "gaza+attack+truce+hamas" is this one . Plenty of sources, both online and offline, can be found that mention these airstrikes as the direct reason for the truce to end. Polozooza ( talk ) 21:33, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Are you joking? i asked WP:RS, not "antiwar" blog. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:36, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
No jokes, just being lazy. ;) It was the first thing that showed up. There are plenty of other sources to be found. Polozooza ( talk ) 21:43, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
While you might be currently in some laziness state, i suggest you make notice of WP:SOAP and WP:OR rules in your free time. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:56, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
There are plenty out there, and im sure on that page too
Im neutral on this, though merging the two and changing the title would make 1 better article instead of 2 shitty ones. Alternatively, to satisfy two possible biases on such 1rr articles, we could paraphrase this on the section f the response on that article and "main" link it here.
Also not to sure that anti-war is the best source, but tehre are plenty Lihaas ( talk ) 21:32, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
With a little work, both articles could easily upgrade above the level "shitty". The other article isn't that bad, either. This one could be (and should be) just as good. The events described, and the results of these events, are certainly noteworthy. Polozooza ( talk ) 21:35, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Both articles seem perfectly justified. I see no reason to merge. Surely we can figure that out later if its appropriate. -- Eraserhead1 < talk > 22:04, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Indeed, and while this article is linked on many pages and on the Main Page, we should strive to expand it as much a possible and make it a proper article. All those templates don't look very nice for readers, I think. ;) Polozooza ( talk ) 22:07, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
I removed the orange tags as they didn't make any sense. -- Eraserhead1 < talk > 23:05, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
I also think this article should be merged into 2011 southern Israel attacks . קולנואני ( talk ) 22:37, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Support merger. קולנואני ( talk ) 21:53, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I think that the best solution would be to have two separate articles. Or take the Gaza raids information to the 2011 southern Israel attacks article as expansion. But until that is made properly I support two articles.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 22:44, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
The way the article stands this has more Gaza reaction to the attack and that has more of the other (which was dubious per ITN). i now strongly support a merge and name change to something like August 2011 Israel-Gaza militant tensions or August 2011 Israel-Gaza attacks ( Lihaas ( talk ) 23:33, 20 August 2011 (UTC)).
Support Move to sandbox or merge per WP:CFORK Wikifan
23:38, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Support merger. The two articles are strongly related. They can always be resplit. Metallurgist ( talk ) 23:38, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Most people dont seem to agree with the interpretation of fork, hnece consensus generating discussions
Metallurgist, whats the point in that? you havent explained.( Lihaas ( talk ) 00:01, 21 August 2011 (UTC)).
Oppose. They look like separate events in separate locations. One in the Aqaba gulf and one in Gaza. Nightw 01:34, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Seem like what? Everything is in this article is in the other one. It is 100% content fork, and arguably a POV one as well. I cannot believe it is being featured. Wikifan
02:32, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Merge. Definitely a content fork - the "background" in this article and the "aftermath" in the other mean they cover basically the same content, and the events cannot well be separated either. Also extremely likely (in this topic area) to become a POV fork. One query: what would the article be called? I don't think it's appropriate to treat Israel's retaliation merely as "aftermath," which we would be implying if we kept the current title of 2011 southern Israel attacks . Roscelese ( talk ⋅ contribs ) 03:38, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Lihaas's suggestion of "August 2011 Israel-Gaza attacks" seems good. Roscelese ( talk ⋅ contribs ) 03:45, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose merger. One side claims they're related, the other side claims they're not. Therefore per NPOV there is no reason to assume they are related. We simply mention that the Israeli government claims that they are related in both articles, which is sufficient to present their POV. Jim Sukwutput 05:54, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Support merger. Retaliation to an act of terrorism is not necessarily sufficient for an article of its own when it can be included in the Southern Israel attacks article as response. The air strikes clearly appear to be a response to what occurred near Eilat. This event would not have occurred otherwise.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 07:11, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose - just doing this for the record. My reasons are stated above in the discussion.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 08:44, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose - and would like to make a different suggestion: Imagine that this thing escalates into another round of Israeli-Gaza war. We then *should* one article on this "Nth Israeli-Gaza war", and one separate article on the the thing that started it all (the attack on the road). Just like we have separate articles for World War I and the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria which was the reason/excuse for this war. But, importantly, we cannot call the second article the "August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids", because then where will we write about the Hamas's retaliation to those, and Israel's 2nd retaliation, and Hamas's 3rd retaliation, and so on and so on? I suggest calling the second article something like August 2011 Gaza-Israel clashes, with the term "clashes" perhaps replaced by something else which the media will call this. Nyh ( talk ) 12:44, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I agree with Nyh. I wouldn't be strongly opposed to a merge if this conflict escalates and the succeeding attacks become more significant (i.e. outright warfare). But right now I don't see any rationale for a merger. Jim Sukwutput
Support merged article (with perhaps a different title) - both the the attacks in Israel and the subsequent air raids in Gaza did not take place in a vacuum, they took place within the broader context of ongoing Palestinian/Israeli attack and retaliation, and for the reader to understand this broader context, both sub-events should be discussed together. Blueboar ( talk ) 20:31, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
But if we take your logic to the extreme, there should only be one article for the seven-decade long conflict. Obviously that'd be silly, so there must be a point where we choose to split up a topic into several articles, right? Jim Sukwutput 20:43, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Comment. Now that 2011 southern Israel attacks has been renamed 2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks , I think it makes the case for a merge into that article even stronger because that title can encompass both the original terrorist attacks and the Israeli air strike into Gaza rendering the point of this article relatively useless by itself. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 21:50, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Merge. For the reasons stated above. Brmull ( talk ) 02:06, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose and Rename to 2011 Gaza - Israel conflict. Merger would result a synthesis of two distinct events. The two are related but not a single campaign. Reliable sources are not saying this is a single event. This would immensely confuse the readers. The current name of the article is also confusing, since it appears to document a one-sided attack rather than bidirectional warfare. Marokwitz ( talk ) 14:13, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Merge for the reasons stated above, also the information seem to be contained in one article without a big problem. 92.46.98.66 ( talk ) 17:58, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Merge as to the reason that Israel always attacks Gaza after they fire rockets and this time is not really that different or special to deserve an article. ( NamflNamfl ) 02:08, 23 August 2011 (UTC) — Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.138.89.253 ( talk )
Comment - due to conflicting renaming proposal this merge proposal is relisted on the noticeboard and due to be discussed according to standard procedures. The conflicting renaming is frozen until the merge voting is closed. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 18:08, 23 August 2011 (UTC)
Huh? What is going on now?-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 00:13, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
You made a conflicting proposal of renaming, while this merging proposal had still been standing, thus your proposal was also disrupting and might even be irrelevant if the merge dicussion outcome is merge. However, if the merging discussion is closed with keep, then we would go back to your renamal proposal. The usual timewindow for each proposal is one week, though it might vary, depending on specific circumstances. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 16:57, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
10 say to merge (~59%). 7 say not to merge (~41%). Does this mean there will be a merge? Israguy ( talk ) 01:04, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
It doesn't really work that way. I/P can be rather partisan so evaluating a discussion based on oppose/supports alone is dubious. As of RIGHT NOW, the article has nothing unique to separate it from the 2011 attacks in southern israel. Literally, virtually everything here - including the infobox - is in the article. A pure fork, POV or not. So if there is anything of worth to merge, fine - but the article needs to be taken down soon. Wikifan
05:36, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
Support merge - Unnecessary content fork, current article does nothing but rehash information already specified in the other. The raids follow and are a direct result of the southern Israel attack, whatever one may feel about Israel's choice of target. Even criticism of Israel's choice of attacking Gaza would be out of place in an article that divorces the raids from the attack that preceded it, when the criticism is centered on the identity of the attackers. Poliocretes ( talk ) 10:50, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
I believe the reasoning for merge is solid and grounded in policy. Only a few sentences would be merged in that case, because the rest of the article is copy-paste from the original article. Wikifan

my edits there were only in relation to what was there, whatever consensus decides is fine by me Lihaas ( talk ) 21:31, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Done, but the objective is synthesis as raids happened in aug 2011 even before the 18 Lihaas ( talk ) 21:39, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Oops. I changed it to a different template before reading this. I didn't think "operational" was appropriate. Honestly this article is unnecessary and IMO a fork. Title should be changed as well. Wikifan
21:48, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Title should be changed to what, exactly? And why is this a fork? Please elaborate. Polozooza ( talk ) 21:52, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
It's a fork of the original article. This is not an independent event, but part of the attacks on Israel prior. All the information here is already in the other article. That is the definition of a fork. Wikifan
23:37, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Thats the basis for this consensus generating debate and hence your opinion. doesnt mean you change things to what you prefer in the meantime while were discussing( Lihaas ( talk ) 23:59, 20 August 2011 (UTC)).
All the information were in the other article only because of your relentless POV-pushing and using the article as your political platform. The other users here are simply cleaning up the mess. Jim Sukwutput 05:47, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
me?( Lihaas ( talk ) 11:27, 21 August 2011 (UTC)).
And rightfully so; the article is linked on the Main Page, after all. Now the other article wasn't too perfect either - the lead was very, very dubious if I recall correctly. Polozooza ( talk ) 09:08, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
No, Lihaas, you've done a great job in this article. I was referring to Wikifan. Jim Sukwutput 12:55, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Is this really a reliable source? The notion that Israeli air attacks is motivated by inner turmoil seems quaint, to say the least. As is the idea that IDF capabilities would be affected by these attacks. Ketil ( talk ) 22:30, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Xinhua is a RS. Discussions as such should be at RSN. Lihaas ( talk ) 22:46, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
An editor continues to say civilian targets were attacked when one of the dead was a Chief Warrant Officer from yammam and "Another fatality was Staff Sgt. Moshe Naftali, 22, of the Israel Defense Forces' Golani Brigade." a bomb by an idf patrol is NOT civilian( Lihaas ( talk ) 23:20, 20 August 2011 (UTC)).
added sources et al to article and clarified both civilian and military targets.
Done?( Lihaas ( talk ) 23:30, 20 August 2011 (UTC)).
Beware of synthesis[ edit ]
Unless we can find a set of reliable sources that agree that separate retaliatory responses by Israel due to separate attacks by Palestinian militants are an single event ("August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids" or similar), then this entire article is a violation of WP:SYNTH . In particular, it's highly doubtful that the earlier Israeli response to a Beer Sheva rocket and the current Israeli response to the Eilat attacks should be considered a single event. Doing so seems to be a transparently POV attempt to make it look like Israel is "attacking" Gaza. It's well known that Israel retaliates in direct response to terrorist (or "militant" or whatever) attacks coming from Palestinians, but each of these needs to be kept strictly separate unless there is clear evidence from reliable sources of linkage. In this case I doubt the Aug 14 rocketing/response has anything to do with the Eilat attacks, esp. as the scope of the Aug 18 Eilat attacks suggests far more time was require to plan this thing than the 4 days between Aug 14 and Aug 18.
I would suggest deleting/merging this article because of this. Benwing ( talk ) 02:38, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
This article was created in response to concerns about an "in the news" item on the Main Page. That news item said Hamas cancelled the de facto truce due to "attacks on Gaza." This article was created as a target for a wikilnk from "attacks on Gaza" to explain what attacks Hamas was talking about. After this article got started, someone asked for citations about air attacks on Gaza in August 2011 that preceded the August 18 incident. Perhaps "synthesis" arises from the article title's mentioning August 2011. I agree the article should report Israel's claim that each air strike into Gaza was a response to a specific provocation. Sharktopus talk 03:27, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
this article shouldn't have been created to begin with. no articles should be created "in response" to other articles. it screams fork. Wikifan
Let's keep the discussion in one place, in this case Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates#.5BPosted.5D_Israel-Hamas_end_of_truce . Though it's a bit pointless as we already have overwhelming consensus, with only Wikifan dissenting. Jim Sukwutput 05:45, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I did not say this article was created "in response to another article." I said it was created in response to a Main Page problem with In the News. Just to give a bit more context, a few months ago ITN had a similar issue with an item about a frog previously thought extinct. ITN was pointing to an article about the frog in question. People complained the article was substandard; the ITN item vanished from the front page, the frog article was improved, the ITN item linking to it was reinstated. There is currently an item at ITN that originally said it was about "attacks on Gaza" but that linked to a (substandard) article about attacks on Israel. Now the ITN item links to both articles. Ultimately, the two articles will probably merge into a single article which will sadly be about a series of attacks, revenge-attacks, revenge-for-revenge-attacks, etc. in the Middle East and involving Israel, Gaza, and Egypt. But as Jim S points out, that discussion will happen somewhere else. Sharktopus talk 11:36, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
The article, as currently reads, is biased to the side of Hamas. The article clearly uses tones and words such as "according to the Israeli government" "for which they blamed the Popular Resistance Committees, who denied involvement.[1]" ". That incident was said to be retaliation for a Palestinian rocket that landed in Beersheba." "some of the alleged 20 perpetrators." "Defense Minister Ehud Barak accused the Popular Resistance Committees" I suggest that the article be re-worded to a more neutral tone as soon as convient. DEWY CHEATEM AND HOWE ( talk ) 05:40, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Which of these statements are not factually correct? Jim Sukwutput 05:42, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
ditto, itd be biased the other side if not. theyre all duly sourced on bnoth pages.( Lihaas ( talk ) 11:22, 21 August 2011 (UTC)).
What you're describing as bias looks like judicious attempts to avoid bias. How is using terms like "according to" (citing a source of a statement) or "alleged" (a term always used in news articles until proof of guilt is established) bias? 70.16.209.81 ( talk ) 15:25, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
A suicide bomber killed several Egyptian soldiers on the Egyptian side of the border with Israel near the Philadelphia Route crossing from where did they got this ? It's quite amusing. Egypt has blamed the deaths on Israel and on wikipedia we find these absurd statements. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 182.178.188.87 ( talk ) 16:26, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I agree with the bias claims - these strikes were in response to the attack on Israeli civilian buses and a private car. They were not the cause of the end of the ceasefire but a response to an attack in which 8 civilians were murdered. User:yoni_bhonker
According to Israel, these strikes were in response to the attacks near Eilat. According to Hamas, these strikes were the motivation for ending the truce. Both statements should be reported and attributed by the article. Sharktopus talk 23:08, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
So you illegally crossed into Egypt and murdered 5 Egyptian soliders in response to attacks on "civilian" buses in your country by a group from another nation? Dig that hole, JIDF. Dig that hole. 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 13:38, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane
Requested Move to August 2011 Gaza Strip air strikes[ edit ]
The following discussion is an archived discussion of a requested move . Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on the talk page. No further edits should be made to this section.
The move request to "August 2011 Gaza Strip air attacks" was postponed, since it interrupted the ongoing merge proposal discussion. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:04, 23 August 2011 (UTC)
the name of this article and proposed move references "raids/strikes" while the one focusing on the israeli side references attacks. Is this npov? 71.180.64.181 ( talk ) 07:44, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Not necessarily. A raid is an attack. Both sides see them as attacks. If 2011 Gaza Strip air attacks then I'd be willing to consider that a possibility for the article name. I'd argue that raid is potentially not NPOV as it is. If strike is also seen by others as not being NPOV compliant, I think attack would be best.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 07:47, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Italicized text added in edit for clarification-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 07:49, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I think it's not npov and it should be changed to "attacks" to match Israeli article. 71.180.64.181 ( talk ) 07:58, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I'm going to withdraw this and re-propose with your suggestion for the most NPOV option.
weak oppose per WP article "Air raid refers to an attack by aircraft against ground or sea targets. The term is generally used for strategic bombing, while airstrike is used for smaller-scale tactical attacks." Its not small scale its strategic and much larger than the pre-=aug 18 strikes that preceded it. Although were getting somewhere in the merge proposal above (perhaps) so we should consolidate this there.( Lihaas ( talk ) 11:25, 21 August 2011 (UTC)).
Support. Article is fork from 2011 Attacks on southern israel. If a conflict mutates from that article - then one can be created. But right now this article is 100% linked to the original attacks. No original content in this article, none at all. Wikifan
12:21, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Let me note that Wikifan is supporting a merger, not a rename. He means oppose here. Jim Sukwutput 12:57, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Jim, and if that rename is unsuccessful for what ever reason? The title is clear POV. Lihaas, if you take a look at strategic bombing or total war two concepts linked to air raid you will see air raid is not a NPOV title. Air raids have a very specific meaning in the historical context. Once again, I must state that I prefer merge before move, but given the fact this is a current event swift actions are needed to clear up present NPOV violations.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 20:00, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I don't have an opinion about the article's title. All I'm pointing out is that Wikifan12345 appears to be confused in that he's actually supporting a merger, not a rename. Not sure if I misunderstood his comment. Jim Sukwutput 20:40, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Nevermind, I didn't quite understand what you meant. I thought Wikifan was supporting a merge yes, but also a rename should the merge fail, but you are right that was not necessarily clear. I think the best way to understand would be for Wikifan to state whatever he feels.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 20:46, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
What's the point of the move, if this article is going to be merged? קולנואני ( talk ) 21:56, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
No concensus on this merge has been reached yet. Both the move and the merge are still being discussed. On a side not: I myself am in favour of a move. The article should be renamed as "August 2011 Gaza Strip attacks". Polozooza ( talk ) 22:06, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Polozooza is correct. In the event that consensus is not reached on the merge, this move is the best way to address NPOV for all sides. I once again must reiterate my difference of opinion with Polozooza however regarding the preferred solution as I feel that a merge to the now renamed 2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks remains the best option.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 22:14, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
"August 2011 Gaza Strip attacks" Why? What ref supports such a title? The title is almost identical to the militant attacks on Israel. No media source is portraying Israel's response to attacks on its own borders as equivalent to the attack on Israeli civilians days before. The article should be merged, all the content here is found in the original article. We don't create articles for military responses to attacks on the Taliban every time they blow up a military or civilian outpost unless its a specific operation. And consensus is not about votes, policy takes precedence and lest we forget this article was created without consensus. Wikifan

RfC on Accuracy of Using Term "Air Raids"[ edit ]
I'm requesting an RfC at both Politics and History on whether air raid is appropriate terminology given its connection to strategic bombing and total war whereas the Gaza strip attacks seem to be carefully targeted strikes based on evidence originally provided and referenced in this article.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 20:16, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Carefully targeted? Sure. Still, the resulted in the death of several civilians, among whom a child. The people killed in Eilat where also "carefully targeted" and the attacks "organised". So why not call it an attack aswell, like that article? Whether it be by land, water or air, an attack is an attack is an attack. Polozooza ( talk ) 20:56, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I'm curious why the front page says "Israel responds to attacks in southern Israel with air strikes on the Gaza Strip." it was Israel who attacked Gaza first with airstrikes, which killed seven civilians one being a child. As we know, """Hamas was not responsible for the attack""", and therefore Israels attack was unprovoked. The front page should read "Gaza responds to airstrikes in Gaza with rocket fire directed at surrounding Israeli cities".
The front page headline is very misleading and I hope it is changed soon.
Here is the timeline of events:
12:00 pm August 18, 2011 A group of armed militants cross the southern Egyptian border into Israel near the city of Eilat.
12:40 pm August 18, 2011 The 3rd phase of the militants operation is commenced with rocket fire from Egypt.
13:30 pm August 18, 2011 Another attack on a Israeli convoy is staged on the Egyptian-Israeli border, killing 4 civilians.five.
hours after* Israeli soldiers clashed with the militants along the Egyptian-Israeli border, killing 5 Egyptian policemen.
Israel then launched retaliation air raids against the Hamas run Gaza Strip killing four plus a child.
With rocket fire in response to the airstrikes.
It's all in the link, from your very own:

You're reading the sources wrong. The attacks occurred on Thursday morning, Israel responded after subduing the original militants in a fire-fight. the child (age has said to be 2 or 12) was the son/daughter of a PRC militant. And as far as Israel is concerned, Hamas is responsible for governing Gaza and thus any attacks originating from it is the fault of Hamas. No international organization has disputed this, nor Has Hamas rejected their control over Gaza which they see as legitimate. Wikifan

Neutral. I don't see a significant difference between "attacks" and "raids". I do however support the merge.

Rename to "2011 Gaza - Israel conflict". This article is about a two sided conflict, not "air raids". Marokwitz ( talk ) 14:19, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Hmm, not a bad idea and neutral too. then we can merge both. Lihaas ( talk ) 20:36, 23 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose rename as this has not been described as an all-out conflict or war. Recent news suggest Israeli government is about to enter an informal cease-fire with Hamas. Unless an actual operation takes place we can't call it a conflict any less than we can call the various spats in Afghanistan/Iraq unique "conflicts." Wikifan
00:13, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
Israeli government is not negotiating with Hamas. Hamas declared a cease-fire, but rockets are still being fired at Israeli cities and towns. Israeli schools and synagogues are destroyed. a 9 months old baby was hospitalized. If this is not an armed conflict - I don't know what IS. Israguy ( talk ) 01:10, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
Rename article name[ edit ]
The current name "August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids" is bias, since it is not clear from this name that the raid is a retaliation for murders of Israelis on Israeli land. Also - not only Gaza is under attack. Beer Sheva , Askelon , Ashdod , Sderot , Netivot and other southern towns of Israel are under attack - just not by "air raid", but "only" by rockets and missles launched from the ground. Name of article should be less bias and more neutral. Israguy ( talk ) 00:55, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
How is this not clear? The very first sentence mentions that the attacks were declared as "retaliation" by the Israeli state, with a helpful link to that article. Jim Sukwutput 08:05, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
Fully agree with you Israguy. We are not alone in this view.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 06:24, 26 August 2011 (UTC)
Copy-pasted from my section on this talk page: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Talk:2011_southern_Israel_cross-border_attacks
Some parts of the article state the nationality of the attackers as Palestinian, based on sources which claim the attackers were members of the Popular Resistance Committees. This is a disputed fact, as the PRC denies involvement, and there are verifiable sources showing that: http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?ID=234512&R=R1
I have amended some parts of the article which state Palestinian nationality, based on claims of PRC membership, and it would be good to see more discussion about and critical analysis of sources which make these claims. Arfed ( talk ) 15:57, 25 August 2011 (UTC)

Fair enough but this article is rubbish and not per MOS and not to mention pov per WTA. How about 2011 southern Israel attacks , if there is another one then we can add th emonth/date. (weve done that before for new delhi in 2008. Lihaas ( talk ) 14:16, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
OK, but just let merge this article into the other one. Because this one is actually rubbish while the other one is on the event and updated.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 14:37, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Problem now. the same title with a capital s and lower case s links to the 2 different pages. Proper term is lower case s as its not a proper noun, but the content at capital s is better.
for gods sake what the heck is going on! Theres no consensus at all for this new incarnation since there were THREE attacks at various places. Lihaas ( talk ) 15:00, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Agree with Lihaas lets merge this article into the 2011 Southern Israel attacks article and move the name 2011 Ein Netafim attacks with it. Easy and best way of solving this.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 15:07, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
It appears that there is disagreement about the title and some confusion on how to solve the disagreement. Therefore, I am opening a discussion. Personally I feel that since there is no official name, and the location of the attacks is called Ein Netafim, the title 2011 Ein Netafim attacks should stay (there was another attack in the same location many years ago, if anyone's interested). If you dispute this, please discuss here. I am going to be out for the next few hours. — Ynhockey ( Talk ) 15:02, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
I agree with you on the name. and that the content from this article should be merged into the 2011 Southern Israel attacks and the name 2011 Ein Netafim attacks be moved to that article.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 15:06, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
per below as well there was no consensus ont he move, thre were MULTIPLE attacks several km from each other. southern with a lower case is better. Lihaas ( talk ) 15:13, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
There were no consensus to move 2011 Southern Israel attacks article into this one.... but anyway its done. But I found the other article to be better.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 15:10, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Because the article covers all three attacks, in my opinion it is better to change the name of the article to 2011 Southern Israel attacks . TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 15:20, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
We seem to have clear consensus on this one. Though may i add 2011 southern Israel attacks . I dont believe "Southern Israel" is a proper noun or official part of teh province or something, its the generic region. Lihaas ( talk ) 15:31, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

Regardless of the name, it was a waste of effort to maintain two different articles. The name can be settled later, I've redirected the other article here so that contributions don't go to waste on parallel articles. Poliocretes ( talk ) 16:44, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
No one is saying that we need to maintain two separate articles - apparently the two articles were created without their authors being aware that they have created duplicate articles. Anyway, what in your opinion is the most appropriate name for this article? TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 16:53, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
I have moved the article to what appears to be the consensus version, even though I disagree with it—it's not as descriptive as the other title, while being the same length. In any case, let's tie up all the loose ends in the article because there were 3 simultaneous articles created and they were slowly merged, but some confusion still exists about the different ones. For now I'll go over all the redirects and see. — Ynhockey ( Talk ) 17:18, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
In my opinion, we need to find a better name in order to distinguish this specific event from the many frequent rocket attacks that have been fired by Palestinian militants at Israeli targets in the southern part of Israel during 2011. Any suggestions? TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 20:07, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
I think the 2 noms above are a little vague at the moment tille more details emerge 8(first) and pov/wta (second).
it seems both attacks occurred miles apart to say that they were at just 1 place of the border crossing is deceptive on the third attack. Eilat (which was the original name) seemed good to me, but more details from others emerged that it was outside eilat. Lihaas ( talk ) 20:41, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
What the heck is a "militant"? Are IDF members militants? I think guerilla is probably the best term.

2011 Ein Netafim attacks is not a bad suggestion at all, but in my opinion, 2011 coordinated guerrilla attacks in southern Israel or 2011 joint guerrilla attacks in southern Israel would work better because the attacks took place out in the wilderness nearby the highway and didn't occur in one specific spot/village/town. What is the most common name/s this event has received in the media? (please specify your sources). TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 21:50, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
But all attacks are not at Ein Netafim, and we dont even have a blue lijnk for it. Lihaas ( talk ) 22:02, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
As far as I know, all the attacks took place in that area. Do you have a more precise map of the attacks? (the current coordinates in the article seem wrong too). — Ynhockey ( Talk ) 23:04, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
I dont, thats why im asking. not sure what the wider Ein Netafim is. I thought it was generally Eilat. (nice airport, in the heart of the city though id say its quite unsecured. and that ol' russiahn plane parked off to look at ;) Nice swim though, but how does security work at the beach by the Jordan border? Missing 3 MOnkeys..;)) Lihaas ( talk ) 23:11, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
How about:
I don't understand why editors manage to remove whole sentences of information, merge unrelated content into ambiguous section titles, and then get away with it.
These kinds of heavy, unilateral edits require consensus. Also, this edit is not line with policy . The source explicitly describes the acts as "terror." It is not the viewpoint of the author, it comes from a reliable source. Guideline: "may express contentious opinion and are best avoided unless widely used by reliable sources to describe the subject, in which case use in-text attribution." Also, - not a policy. No shame in using the T word at 2011 Norway attacks so why can't it be used here?
This edit isn't even supported by the source. And this is SYNTH as the source does not mention the The Popular Resistance Committees nor does the source explicitly dispute claims that the perps were in fact PRC members. So again editors are inserting their own views in the article and it shows. I've already used up my 1 revert but I think Lihaas has made at least 6 in the last 24 hours which is sanctionable. Wikifan
22:01, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Oh for the love of god, inm not revertign anything. Im adding content and sources and explaining everything,. At any rate, also comment on CONTENT. the edit conflicts that i happen to overwrite and readded back (take for example the edit that updated 8 deaths, etc)
to explain the edits, the reorg of the section (which is NOT a revert of anything but an original edit) is in line organising content as per other attacks artickes when some sections are nothing but 1 line and unsourced at that. Look at the first link and youll see missing fact tags.
Swarm's edit is right (and it has nothign to do with me) as we dont copy word-for-word from sources, this is not a news service to parrot the media. WTA explicitly says not to use such controversial words unless in quotes. (for which those in the reactions that call it so are duly mentioned)
the original al jazeera page mentioned the soldiers on board heading to eilat, they must have changed the bit. often they change stuff keeping the sdame link. probs we can remove that then. It is in the source, i just read it. "soldiers on their way home from their respective bases for the weekend."
Per PRC see the next section (ill go and tag the source there, there was a jpost source that said so)
Done Lihaas ( talk ) 22:08, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Lihaas, adding content is one thing - removing content (and their sources) counts as a revert. Compare the first version to the second. ARBPIA is firm on 1rr per 24 hours to prevent issues like this from arising. Swarm's edit is disputable because the link he cites as a reason is a guideline, not a policy, and the guideline explicitly says go with what the sources say. Norway attack are described as terror in nature in the very first sentence. I encourage you self-revert and restore one of the earlier versions of the article. Wikifan
22:19, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
What content and sources did i remove? Tell me and ill more than happily avoid this sort of conflict by reverting my edit. I dont think a blanket revert of an entire version would help as it will remove a LOT of other stuff. But if you tell me what i rvted, i will surely self-rvt the controversy.
Norway attack sholdnt say that and ought to be changed. Lihaas ( talk ) 22:28, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Okay Lihaas, I'm going to be as brief and concise as possible.
this needs to go . None of the sources are suggesting a conflict of who is responsible for this attack. Just because a source doesn't mention a guilty party does not mean they oppose sources that previously stated the perps. Get it? It's call synthesis. Understand it. Breath it. Get it. I see this all the time on Israeli-related articles. Unless an RS says, specifically, "while x said these guys did it, y has yet to confirm said journalism blah blah." We as editors cannot ASSUME this , even if it might be true. Wikifan
23:32, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Firstly; refrain from NPA you comment on CONTENT "Understand it. Breath it. Get it." Secondly how is that a revert? what was reverted in adding a NEW section per WP:BOLD .
How is it then synthesis to cite EXACTLY WHAT IS IN THE SOURCES that security services pblamed PRC. Especially since the infoboxmentions it without a word of prose in the article. That is okay and not synthesis?
See Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates#Attack_in_Israel for more and more sources that OTHER editors too have said dont attribute claims. Lihaas ( talk ) 23:40, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
BE BOLD is something not to be used at I/P articles. Editors are limited 1 RR per 24 hours and are expected to gain a consensus or at least explain large removal or expansion of edits made unilaterally in discussion.
I'm looking at the sources, none of them cite a conflict between x source saying PRC is guilty but b source saying "no, that hasn't been confirmed yet."
I'll even post the sources for you.
Im nost sure if Clinton should come before or after the State Depts reaction. What do others think? is the minister or ministry more important? (which per Yes Minister is mostly civil servants who apparently know more)
Also to explain my reorg per a statement above: i tried to be more neutral in the reactions by saying "regional" instead of involved as we dont yet know for sure whos involved. Lihaas ( talk ) 22:25, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Well in the US, the reaction of the actual Secretary is the most important. The rest of the State Dept is just beaurocrats meant to write her speeches, process passports, arrange meetings, etc. The US gov is more about the personalities that run the departments rather than the department themselves.

Unexplained and dubuious edit summary by an admin here. The addition was duly noted in the edit summary and explained, this is vandalism if there was one.
Added on the premiuse that its multiple attacks in a city by non-state actors and hence clearly similar, at least without consensus or explanation fo removal. Lihaas ( talk ) 23:51, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
I agree. Also, "don't be ridiculous" is rather offensive. Suggesting the event is somehow less tragic than the attacks on India. I'm not familiar with the "see also" policy. The only editor-related issue I have is the "don't be ridiculous" which is totally offensive. Wikifan
00:17, 19 August 2011 (UTC)
While the edit summary is not appropriate, the removal is hardly vandalism : "a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia". In addition, I think that the removal is justified unless a reliable source makes the connection; else, the claim that both events were "multiple attacks in a city by non-state actors and hence clearly similar" is an original conclusion . -- Black Falcon ( talk ) 19:42, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Is this article going to be part of a potentially greater conflict? three injured by rocket . It seems as though the original attacks have led to further engagements, yet all appear to be connected to the first attack. Suggestions? Wikifan
03:30, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
This is part of a conflict that has been ongoing for at minimum the past 70 years. There are reactions to reactions to reactions to reactions. So, I'd say let's be a bit conservative here in limiting the scope to what's actually relevant to the attack. I suggest cutting it off at "Israeli retaliation". -- Bob drobbs ( talk ) 18:15, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
This Jerusalem Post Article appear to conflict with this BBC News Article . The BBC Article reports the Egyptian policemen were shot by Israeli forces however it's not confirmed by Israel but they've starting an inquiry whereas an Israeli news station reports that Palestinian suicide bombers killed the Egyptian policemen. According to the BBC article Egypt claims they were shot by Israel however Israeli news says they were killed by Palestinians. I can't make sense of whether on not this is biased Israeli news or not.

Israeli news says that Israeli forces were shot upon, near the Israel-Egypt border. The Israeli forces shot back, towards the origin of the fire that was shot at them. It seems that the terrorists located themselves very close to an Egyptian post, and therefor Egyptian policemen were shot, when the Israeli force returened fire. But nothing is 100% confirmed yet. קולנואני ( talk ) 20:05, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
They now have their own article: August 2011 Gaza Attack . Makes things a lot easier, I'd say. It is these retaliations, after all, that resulted in Hamas calling off the truce.

Polozooza ( talk ) 20:11, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
I'm not sure this is a good idea. Israel was attacked by Palestinians. Israel retaliated, and after that - the Palestinians will also retaliate, which will cause Israel to retaliate again, and who knows when this will end. So, what's the point in spliting these articles? קולנואני ( talk ) 22:35, 20 August 2011 (UTC)

Uh, Israel broke the ceasefire. It's amazing how many times you JIDF think Israel breaking a truce and then being counter-attacked makes the guys who retaliated to be "the ones who broke the truce". It's like Israel is some guy repeatedly punching some other guy in the face and then starts raging about getting revenge for that "unprovoked attack" when he finally punches back...but with an entire nation and nukes. It's pathetic and it's sad you JIDF even think anyone is buying it despite your desperate attempts to troll any responses away. 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 13:42, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane

In the sense that some/most/all (not sure) of the rockets fired from Gaza to Israel were not fired by Hamas itself, but by other terror organizations. קולנואני ( talk ) 22:46, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
In the sense that Hamas and its apologists claim to be the elected government of Gaza, and expect to be granted legitimacy as such when dealing with the international community, they can't suddenly claim to be just one many terrorist gangs when it suits them. Pedantrician ( talk ) 20:00, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
How is that undue? There is nothing undue about including fatalities of those killed. There were no "corresponding" Palestinian victims, in the sense of Israelis being killed in cold-blood while Palestinians were killed as Israeli bombed militant targets in Gaza.
Plenty of other articles involve fatality lists. I suggest a self-revert, I'm not sure if I can restore it as I may have used up my 1rr in the last 24hrs. Wikifan
One killed in Beersheva by a Grad[ edit ]
Gaza terrorists bombarded cities in Israel's southern region Saturday night. One person was killed when a Grad rocket hit Be'er Sheva, and another two were critically wounded. Four others were wounded as well, and are in serious-to-moderate condition. [1]
Is "bombarded" the right word the use? They did not use bombs, but fired long range missles. Israguy ( talk ) 05:08, 21 August 2011 (UTC)

Moved section on 'Other Attacks'[ edit ]
It clearly belongs further down in the chronology. Placing it before the Israeli Air Strike section is misleading, as it would seem to suggest that it was also involved in precipitating those Israeli attacks. 174.91.156.71 ( talk ) 01:08, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
POV problem with Jerusalem Post as a source about these attacks[ edit ]
This article should be based on news sources that distinguish between partisan claims and established fact. Instead, a plurality of its references come from a single right-wing source, the Jerusalem Post . These Jerusalem Post references parrot the Israeli government claim (that the PRC was responsible for the attacks) as if it were established fact.
"... the Popular Resistance Committees, the organization who orchestrated the terror attacks near Eilat on Thursday that left eight people dead. " [2]
"...Israel’s response to the terror attacks from the Sinai Peninsula came swiftly Thursday evening when the Israel Air Force bombed the southern Gaza Strip, killing the leadership of the Popular Resistance Committee (PRC), who had orchestrated the attacks." [3]
We don't yet know who was responsible, and the PRC has denied being involved. Articles that claim otherwise are opinion pieces, not WP:RS news stories. Sharktopus talk 01:56, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Jerusalem Post is an RS. As it stands the article does not say the PRC is responsible, but quotes the views of the IDF, Hamas, PRC (denied), etc. It's not that we don't know who is responsible - it's that other news organizations are slower to respond. This is a regional event, so of course native sources will jump to conclusions faster as information arrives. And the Israeli gov. is just as reliable as the USA/Canada. US news routinely accepts the claims of NATO without challenge. Wikifan
02:28, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
The New York Times in a RS, but we do not treat opinion pieces in the NYT as reliable sources on matters of fact. I don't think Wikipedia should treat US/Canada/NATO/Israel claims as established fact when those claims are seriously disputed. Sharktopus talk 02:39, 21 August 2011 (UTC)

The two JP items I linked to above, both with the byline of "Yaakov Katz," cross the line from news to opinion when they both claim as established fact that Eilat attacks were by the PRC. Sharktopus talk 11:03, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
No, they didn't "cross the line." Jerusalem Post is an RS, the sources you link are not editorials.
11:30, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Oh come now, JPost isn't right-wing, and definitely not right-wing to the point of not being an RS (that distinction belongs to Arutz Sheva ). Though, we could still broaden our sources. Western media is still reporting on this, as shown by the NY Times article I linked further down on the Talk, so we could use some of those. We could also use YNet and HaAretz as well. Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie | Say Shalom! 12:55, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Is there an ironclad definition somewhere on Wikipedia of what constitutes a RS? The definitions that I've found seem to make it situational: it depends on whether the editor du jour approves of what the source is saying.. If I were defining it, I would include such criteria as, does the source include both sides of the issue and quote opposing views fairly and accurately. By these criteria, Arutz Sheva passes the test. If it is disqualified simply because it is right wing (i.e., it reports on stories that the rest of the media would just as soon the public know nothing about), then of course it fails. But it beats me why CNN, which openly admitted that it was faking the news from Iraq to please Saddam Hussein, the BBC, whose Arab reporters in Gaza openly declare that they see their reportage as part of the Palestinian struggle against Israel, the New York Times, which displays photos of bloodied Jews on the front page but calls them Arabs, Reuters, who happily accept Photoshopped images until caught, or Ha'Aretz, which does not present anything but the left wing side of the issue, are all unquestioned RS. I believe even Al Jazeera is an RS, no? They obviously have a political agenda, but of course they aren't labeled classic right wing (and Arutz Sheva even quotes them fairly, by the way. Pedantrician ( talk ) 18:51, 23 August 2011 (UTC)
Doesn't it seem to you that an article based largely upon a single source is a problem? Especially when somebody points out at least a few cases where that source has conflated opinion with news, failing to identify disputed points? I may well be in error calling it right-wing, based on what I read in Jerusalem Post . Sharktopus talk 13:09, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
There are 80 sources cited which is very respectable, and JP is definitely not a "right wing" source. If you have POV or factual accuracy concerns about specific facts, we can discuss them individually. Marokwitz ( talk ) 13:40, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
At the time I first expressed this concern, the article had 57 references, a respectable number; more than 20 of those references went to articles in the J Post, which I thought was a problem. The article is much better now than it was a few days ago. I have identified a couple of problems with a couple of J Post articles in this thread, purely wrt their asserting as "fact" a disputed claim that the PRC was responsible for Eilat attacks. Maybe they were, but international media RS have not asserted that connection as a fact. Sharktopus talk 14:28, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Article Name Problem[ edit ]
There's a problem with the name as is. As I understand it, this article is about the series of 3 attacks which happened in immediate succession a few days ago. Is that right?
However, the article title makes it sound like it should include each and every attack in Southern Israel from all of 2011.
Does anyone have a suggestion for a better name? -- Bob drobbs ( talk ) 03:12, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
There is no need to change the name of this article. South Israel is under attack. The series of 3 attacks were only the beggining. Israguy ( talk ) 05:31, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Indeed, there are still rockets being fired into the South. It's even still being reported in the New York Times, amazingly enough. [4] O_O Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie | Say Shalom! 12:30, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
"(though Hamas had never actually ceased rocket attacks into Israel)"
On the surface this appears to be editorializing. Our very own article Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel itself indicates that such rocket attacks occurred between 2001 and 2009, suggesting that they in fact were significantly diminished. The article goes on to indicate that in 2010 and 2011 there were a number of rocket attacks, but much fewer than before. The editorial parenthetical appears to dismiss this nuance. -x
The relatively non-existant Hamas ceasefire that the article seems to quote appears to be Israelis unilateral ceasefire (link) . The article at the start of the so called ceasefire shows that Israel intended to take indefinite action but Hamas was only limiting it to a week. And while the attacks may have died down, they by no means stopped. Truce does not mean a reduction in violence, it means ceaseation. Just because the media used a word does not mean the definition is being used correctly, and just because the other article in question seems not to cover 2010 and 2011 does not mean that a ceasefire occurred. I'd argue that article is incomplete and out of date.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 07:06, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Hamas stopped firing rockets themselves, but certain factions like Islamic Jihad managed to fire between one and five rockets a month. There was even a two month period without rockets and Hamas said they were cracking down on the various factions within Gaza to make them stop (which they were apparently. Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie | Say Shalom! 12:35, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Then I stand corrected.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 20:27, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
In which section should have include the part that mentions the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers?[ edit ]
Were the 5 Egyptian soldiers killed during the period of the original series of attacks (roughly between 12:00 - 18:00 pm) or were they killed after the original series of attacks? If they were killed during the initial series of attacks - we must move the part which covers the their death to the "The attacks" section instead of the "Israeli retaliation" section in which this section is currently in. TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 17:20, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Since I'm already at 1RR, I have placed a POV tag on the article due to CuriousGnome's removal - or rather I should say selective removal, of Palestinian casualties from the infobox. I believe it is sophistry to pretend that this article and its accompanying infobox pertain only to the initial attack, when an entire section of the article is devoted to Israeli retaliations and rightly so. The fact that Gnome (and now Wikifan) have retained only the militant casualties from the Israeli airstrikes makes these edits all the more indefensible. I appeal to the editors in question to restore the full casualty figures. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:09, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Wait, don't mix my edits with CuriousGnome. I did not "retain" only militant casualties. However IMO the infobox should only include casualties from the original attacks. Any Palestinians militants/civilians killed later shouldn't be in the infobox. It confuses the reader. Wikifan
16:14, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Well then, could you at least remove the (+7 attackers) from the infobox? I still don't agree with the reasoning, but you (or gnome) can't have it both ways, either all the Palestinian casualties should be included or none. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:21, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Information regarding the Palestinians killed during the actual series of cross-border terror attacks and following battle which brought an end to the August 18th cross-border attacks is currently included in the infobox which covers the actual series of cross-border terror attacks and following battle which brought an end to the August 18th cross-border attacks (the infobox has been moved to the section of the article which covers this event to prevent confusion). This infobox should not contain additional information related to the subsequent events that took place in the following hours and/or days. If do you think that there are still errors in the information that appears in infobox, please state these errors in an objective and civil manner, and we will fix the infobox in order for it to reflect the reality objectively. TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 16:22, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
In my opinion, we can certainly consider, as a balanced approach, to add an additional infobox in the "Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip" section which would contain data relating to these subsequent events. What do you think of this compromise proposal? TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 16:28, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
It's better than nothing. We may have to address the larger issue at some stage however. BTW, I think your infobox casualty figures are out in any case, I count only six militants killed in the initial attacks, four by Israel and two by Egypt, but the infobox currently indicates a total of nine. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:30, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Too many infoboxes. Assuming the other article remains, explicit information about Palestinian deaths and a unique infobox should be moved there. I added an infobox to that article when it was first created but someone removed it. Wikifan
16:35, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
The other article should probably be merged with this one, they are obviously covering the same event. And "too many infoboxes" may not be ideal, but it's certainly a good deal better than a single infobox that covers only half the casualties. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:45, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
I'm not terribly happy with the fact that Gnome has employed a different infobox for the Israeli airstrikes, but as I indicated earlier, this seems to be a problem related to the limitations of the "civilian attack" infobox. We may have to take a closer look at that issue at some stage. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:59, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
I agree with Gatoclass that an additional template is needed mainly due to the sensitivity of the subject and as a current more balanced approach. For this reason, and because in this current discussion this is the decision of the majority, I took the liberty of adding a new template to the "Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip" section (Gatoclass - if you now object to the use of this template I will remove it immediately). Nevertheless, in my opinion, in the distant future when we would be able to see the whole event and subsequent events in a better perspective, we can definitely considered, based on the decision of the majority in the discussion page of course, summarizing the "Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip" section and having the infobox appear only in the August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids article. TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 17:03, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
As I said CuriousGnome, I am not entirely happy with the infobox you added, but I think if you cleared the "partof" field it would be more acceptable. It looks very odd to me to have Israeli strikes categorized as "part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict" while the Palestinian attacks that preceded and followed are not so categorized. But as a compromise, if you would agree to clear the field in question, I could probably agree to removing the pov tag. Gatoclass ( talk ) 17:07, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
I've added the "Part of Israeli–Palestinian conflict" section to the infobox of the attack. Does this seem as an acceptable compromise to you? TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 17:17, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Okay, that seems reasonable. I've removed the POV tag. Gatoclass ( talk ) 17:50, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
The lead says that the perpetrators are assumed to be Palestinian while the infobox says flat out that they are. However, Egyptian authorities say that they have identified three of the people responsible and that at least one of them is based in Sinai (see here ). As such, I am removing the infobox line.
nableezy - 18:06, 23 August 2011 (UTC)
US/Israel say Palestinian militants, CNN says Palestinian militants . No one has suggested this attack was committed by some other people. Need a better source to support Egyptian claims. Wikifan
00:16, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
So, the US and Israel "say" but Egypt "claims", and an Egyptian newspaper is not a reliable source why exactly?
nableezy - 00:47, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
So, did you read my full edit? CNN says Palestinian militants, US intelligence and Israeli intelligence say Palestinian militants (all published in RS), a non-RS Egyptian newspaper doesn't say non-Palestinian, just "three men." More than a dozen were involved in the attacks, perhaps more who planned it. Wikifan
00:53, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
Wait a second, why is al-Masry al-Youm not a reliable source? It is a major news source in Egypt, you cant simply dismiss sources you dislike. The source says that one of them men is the head of a Sinai based "terrorist cell", not from Gaza.
nableezy - 01:19, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
I never said I didn't like it, I just assumed it was. And the infobox does not say Gaza Palestinian militants, just "Palestinian militants." Wikifan
01:27, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
You just assumed it was why? Because it isnt Israeli or American? The al-Masry al-Youm source contradicts the claim that they were Palestinian. You cant just accept the Israeli narrative as gospel truth and claim any Arab source must be unreliable.
nableezy - 15:52, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
And to alleviate your concern with using an Egyptian source, an Israeli one repeats the report al-Masry al-Youm and says three of the attackers were Egyptian. Though the article currently goes further than the source (Ill correct that shortly).
nableezy - 15:54, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
The "fatalities" section also refers to "Palestinian militants". I'm concerned about such statements. If no-one has taken responsibility for the attacks, then we can't be sure the attackers were Palestinian. They may, for example, have been indigenous Egyptians allied with AQ or another radical group. I think it would be appropriate if the article ceased to refer to the attackers as "Palestinian" as if their identity were known with certainty. Gatoclass ( talk ) 04:47, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
Gato, you know better than this. Wikipedia is all about verifiability. Everyone in this section are Palestinians. They attackers may been from mars, right now we just go with what sources say. CNN cite above lists Palestinian militants without citing Israel/Egypt/other sources, so either that is their own independent reportage or something else. Some say Gaza-based al qaeda affliate . No source has suggested any "indigenous Egyptians" of being complicit in this incident. Wikifan
05:02, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
Perhaps not, but since the identity of the attackers has yet to be confirmed, they could have been anyone, which is the point I am making. Gatoclass ( talk ) 09:45, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
Not disputing that. Wikifan
22:46, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
Israel News say that some of the perpetrators are Egyptians but most of them are Palestinian from Gaza. And some of them are confirmed Popular Resistance Committees members. Israguy ( talk ) 00:44, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
Source? I don't like these claims that the militants were Palestinian, since all of the citations supporting it just make that assertion, without qualifying those claims. Does this not fall foul of some WP rules regarding verifiability? Arfed ( talk ) 15:06, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
How is news.xinhuanet.com a RS? It seems to me that the link provided is not for a news report, but to a personal colum. Israguy ( talk ) 01:16, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
Personal column? That's the furthest from the truth you can get. Xinhua is actually the official news agency of the People's Republic of China. They have a POV of course with respect to issues in China, but on international issues they tend to rely on international sources. They're fast and have the most detailed information, which is why they get used so frequently on recent events articles. As for reliability, the community has previously decided that Xinhua would be a RS regardless of content, unless specifically for contentious issues in China. Jim Sukwutput 22:23, 27 August 2011 (UTC)
Some parts of the article state the nationality of the attackers as Palestinian, based on sources which claim the attackers were members of the Popular Resistance Committees. This is a disputed fact, as the PRC denies involvement, and there are verifiable sources showing that: http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?ID=234512&R=R1
I have amended some parts of the article which state Palestinian nationality, based on claims of PRC membership, and it would be good to see more discussion about and critical analysis of sources which make these claims.
Someone cited this article, which casts doubts on PRC origin of militants: http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/doubts-emerge-over-identity-of-terrorists-who-carried-out-attack-in-israel-s-south-1.380525 Arfed ( talk ) 13:56, 26 August 2011 (UTC)
Ha'aretz: Rocket attacks on Friday, August 19[ edit ]
Hi. According to this news story from Ha'aretz, eight additional Israelis were killed by rocket attacks coming from Gaza on Friday (Aug. 19). The names mentioned are different from those in the article referring to the Thursday, August 18 victims, except for the Gaz and Karlinskis (yet those four fatalities were mentioned as occurring on the Thursday). Are additional references required to back up the claim of Friday fatalities? Thanks. ~ AH1  ( discuss !) 02:22, 26 August 2011 (UTC)
One Israeli person was killed by Grad rocket, the rest (other eight Israelis) had previously been killed in the cross-border attack. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:50, 29 August 2011 (UTC)

Despicable pictures of a DIFFERENT attack[ edit ]
I see Israel is out in full force trying to make itself look like the victim again. Even IF there is a legitimate argument for including the incident Israel claims began their murder of 5 Egyptian soldiers, the pictures have absolutely no place. It is a sub-section of an article unrelated to that sub-section, PICTURES of the cars attacked from a DIFFERENT incident have no place here. It's a clear, deliberate attempt to push a Pro-Israel justification POV. They must be deleted at once. 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 13:50, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane
Pictures are of the cross-border attack in question. I don't know what other attack you are talking about, you seem to have missed something. Poliocretes ( talk ) 13:58, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
No, they are not. They are of a seperate incident. Perhaps you should read next time, seeing as that sub-section mentions it in the heading. Explain how a bus being egged relates to this article on Israel's attack on egypt? 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 14:00, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane
Have you actually READ the article? The incident begun with an attack on Israel, which the photos depict. I will now reinstate the photos, and if you don't like it, feel free to report me. Poliocretes ( talk ) 14:10, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
Which is ALREADY COVERED. But nice try. Those photos relate in no way to this article. Just as pictures of every person killed being posted relates in no way to this article. If those pictures are in sources then they are represented to required amount. Desperately trying to display photos to garner sympathy for Israel in an article about Israel's attack on Egypt, when Egypt played no part in those bus attacks, is not allowed.
So, again, I point out to you that those pictures are not allowed to be posted. They are POV and POV relating to ANOTHER attack, not this articles head-line. That one incident caused another is already covered. Pointless information regarding the other attack has NO place in an article devoted to the attack on Egypt.
And I say again...present a reason why pictures of cars (which do not display anything in relation to the article other than pitiful shock value) and a BUS THAT HAS BEEN EGGED relate in ANY way to THIS article and incident? Pictures are reinstated and you will be reported if you continue to ignore Wikipedias rules. 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 14:15, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane
IP user, it is usually recommended to read the article before editing it. Marokwitz ( talk ) 14:17, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
IP, Egged is the name of the Israeli national bus company, it's not a bus that has been egged. You're completely out of your depth and better stop. Poliocretes ( talk ) 14:21, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
LOL. Marokwitz ( talk ) 14:25, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
Lol at the fact you think a buses company name is a reason for it to be included.
facepalm*
Pictures of a spood found near the site doesn't need its own picture either. Nor would it be allowed to post pictures of those Egyptians murdered by Israel. The latter being part of the direct subject of this article (Israel's attack that crossed into Egypt) and still not allowed. So no, a sub-section relating to a different incident isn't allowed to include pictures already covered in detail by multiple sources. Try again. 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 14:32, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane
Please point out the wikipedia policy guidelines that support the above assertions. You seem to be suffering an extreme case of WP:IJUSTDONTLIKEIT . Oh, and what you're doing on WikiProject Egypt is called WP:CANVASSING , and accusing seasoned editors of being sock puppets is a sure way of getting blocked. Poliocretes ( talk ) 15:15, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
I think the infobox to be used should be "Template:Infobox military conflict" as during the latter part of the attack a firefight broke out between the Egyptians and Israelis and several Egyptian soldiers were killed. This was not a simple civilian attack. VR talk 04:48, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
This is
(a)denied by spokesmen for those committees in the lead itself. So we have two versions, the IDF's and the PRC's.
(b) The source for the line makes no such claim (note 2)
(c) googling rapidly, I see that several sources, one a blog though hosted by Tikkun Olam, assert that the IDF's own enquiry concluded no Gazans were involved.
Max Blumenthal says this has been disproved.
Edited Egyptian Protests section[ edit ]
The last line of the original text showed gloating from whoever put it in. Some evidence of this is the reference of the article for Million-man demonstration being an Egyptian news site, while the other about being only "a few hundred" is an Israeli one. If you want to edit it back to the original please reply to me here with your reasons & why I'm wrong. Thank you. StoneCold45 ( talk ) 17:58, 19 March 2013 (UTC)

What is QuickiWiki?
QuickiWiki takes the amazing Wikipedia content and presents it to users using the latest technologies.
Why?
Wikipedia is based on community contributions and financial donations.
The first part works amazing: people all over the world collaborating to create the world's largest encyclopedia.
The second part – well, it seems that people are not as cooperative when it comes to their wallets: Wikipedia's budget is very limited, resulting in a website that looks more like a private blog than the world's 6th largest site (I mean, images that open in a new page? Really?)
QuickiWiki allows people to access Wikipedia's content through a quicker and more modern interface, enhancing it with images, videos and more (How about being able to play the movie trailer from within the film's page?)
Hey! Aren't you stealing Wikipedia's work?
Quite the opposite. Wikimedia (the awesome people behind Wikipedia) have made all its content free and available to all humankind.
Actually, by using QuickiWiki you are reducing load from Wikipedia's servers and saving them money!
Cool idea. I'm in!
2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks
Site of the attacks
Deaths
6 Israeli civilians, 1 Israeli soldier, 1 Israeli Yamam policeman, 5 Egyptian soldiers, 10 attackers [2]
Non-fatal injuries
Perpetrators
Presumably 12 assailants. Israel has stated that the attacks were orchestrated by the Gaza based Popular Resistance Committees , who deny involvement. [4] Egyptian sources report that three of the attackers were Sinai-based Egyptians. [2] [5]
On August 18, 2011, a series of cross-border attacks with parallel attacks and mutual cover was carried out in southern Israel on Highway 12 near the Egyptian border by a squad of presumably 12 militants in four groups. [2] The attacks occurred after Israel's interior security service Shin Bet had warned of an attack by militants in the region and Israeli troops had been stationed in the area. [6] The militants first opened fire at an Egged No. 392 bus as it was traveling on Highway 12 in the Negev near Eilat . [3] [7] Several minutes later, a bomb was detonated next to an Israeli army patrol along Israel's border with Egypt. In a third attack, an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians. [8] Eight Israelis – six civilians, one Yamam special unit police sniper and one Golani Brigade soldier—were killed in the multiple-stage attack. [9] [10] The Israel Defense Forces reported eight attackers killed, and Egyptian security forces reported killing another two. [2]
Five Egyptian soldiers were also killed. According to Egypt, they were killed by Israeli security forces chasing militants across the Egyptian border, while an Israeli military officer initially said they were killed by a suicide bomber who had fled across the border into Egypt. [11] The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between Egypt and Israel and led to mass protests outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo. According to media reports, Egypt threatened to withdraw its ambassador to Israel, but Egypt's foreign minister later denied this. [2] Israel expressed regret over the deaths, and sent a letter of apology to Egypt. [12] The IDF was ordered to conduct a military probe of the incident, [13] [14] and on August 25, 2011, Israel agreed to a joint investigation with Egypt of the events. [15]
The identity of the attackers, three of whom were reportedly Egyptian, [16] is not widely agreed upon, [17] and so far no group took responsibility for the attacks. The Israeli government accused the Palestinian Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), a Gaza -based coalition of Palestinian militant groups, of orchestrating the attacks, [18] but the PRC denies involvement. [19] However, Israel attacked seven targets in the Gaza Strip immediately after the terror attacks in the Negev, killing five members of the PRC, including its leader. [20]
On August 21, 2011, an informal ceasefire was called by Israel and Hamas after days of escalating violence in which fifteen Palestinians were killed and many were wounded. More than 100 rockets and mortar shells were fired from Gaza into Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding more than a dozen. [21] The ceasefire was broken almost immediately by rocket fire from Gaza on southern Israel, followed by retaliatory Israeli airstrikes, killing at least seven Palestinians, among them two leaders of the Islamic Jihad . On August 26, 2011, Gaza militants called a second truce. [22] On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , Zuhir al-Qaisi , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks. [23]

Egypt–Israel border north of Eilat near where the attacks took place. Egypt is on the left, Israel on the right.
The southern part of Israeli Highway 12 runs adjacent to Israel's border with Egypt. It was the scene of previous shooting attacks in the 1990s.[ citation needed ] In the late 2000s, the Israeli government decided to build the Israel–Egypt barrier , although by 2011 only 10% of it had been completed, none close to the site of the attack. [24]
Following the 2011 Egyptian revolution militant organizations increased their activity in the Sinai Peninsula and Al-Qaeda militants groups were established, [25] after Egyptian police had all but completely withdrawn from the northern Sinai, dominated by Bedouin tribes. During the months preceding the cross-border attacks, Egypt reinforced its forces with about 1,000 additional soldiers in the Sinai Peninsula, with the consent of Israel, after a series of five bombings had disrupted the flow of natural gas to Israel. [26]
On July 30, militants staged an attack on an Egyptian police station in El-Arish, killing six. [27]
On August 2, a group claiming to be the Sinai wing of Al Qaeda declared its intention to create an Islamic caliphate in the Sinai. [28]
On August 14, 2011, Egyptian forces swept the Sinai Peninsula in search of terror cells. [29] Jordanian intelligence informed the Israelis that they had information about an impending terror attack in the south of Israel. [30] Two days prior to the attack, the Egyptian army captured four Islamist insurgents as they prepared to blow up a gas pipeline in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula. [31]
Israeli interior security service Shin Bet had warned of terrorist attacks being planned in the region in an area 80 kilometers long, presuming that they would take place at night. The warnings led to a massive deployment of IDF troops, [6] and the closing of Highway 12, which was reopened only on the day of the attack at the order of head of IDF's southern command Tal Russo . [32]
August 18 cross-border attacks and immediate Israeli response
The original attacks occurred in three coordinated stages. [8] They were carried out by 12 militants in four groups dispersed over an area 12 kilometers long. At least some of the attackers wore brown uniforms, similar to those used by the Egyptian Army . [2] Israeli military and police forces, in cooperation with Shin Bet , began pursuing the perpetrators immediately after the attacks commenced and locked down the area. [33]
The attacks commenced around 12:00 pm (UTC+2) near the Ein Netafim spring, on Highway 12 from Mitzpe Ramon to Eilat , when three militants spread out about 200 meters from one another, [10] armed with suicide bomb vests, grenades , RPGs , and machine guns opened fire on an Egged passenger bus on line 392, carrying mostly soldiers but also some civilians. [8] Seven passengers were wounded, most of them soldiers. [34] According to eyewitnesses, a white car was following the bus, and a group of people dressed in military uniforms got out and opened fire. The bus driver, Benny Belevsky, did not stop the bus and sped away, getting to an IDF post near the Netafim Border Crossing . [35]
The militants, dressed in brown uniforms resembling those of the Egyptian Army, then began attacking passing vehicles, waving white handkerchiefs to fool motorists. [2] One of the militants attacked a bus that drove by and detonated the suicide bomb belt he was wearing, killing himself and the bus driver, who had stopped the empty bus. [34] Another militant opened fire at a passing car and killed the female driver. The same militant then fired an RPG at an Israeli Air Force helicopter, but missed. An IDF jeep from the Golani Brigade then arrived at the scene and ran over the militant, killing him. [10] Another Golani Brigade jeep arrived, and ran over a roadside bomb. As the soldiers exited the damaged vehicle, the surviving militant opened fire at them. Soldiers and Yamam special police officers then located the militant and killed him in a gunbattle. Two other militants then opened fire at the from Egyptian territory. Israeli forces briefly crossed the border and killed both of the militants. One Israeli soldier was killed by friendly fire during the engagement and several soldiers were wounded. [36] [37] [38] [39] The Egyptian Army informed the IDF that its soldiers killed two more militants in the Sinai. [10]
In the third attack, which occurred around 12:35, mortar shells were fired at soldiers carrying out routine maintenance work at the security fence constructed along the border between Israel and Egypt. No one was hurt in the attack. [33] [40]
Around 13:30, not far from the first shooting incident, militants opened fire, including with an anti-tank missile , at a bus and private car on route 90, a desert road near the border with Jordan . According to medics, five people were killed in the attacks. [7] Seven people were wounded when another private vehicle was hit by an anti-tank missile. Eyewitnesses suggested that some of the attackers may have been wearing Egyptian Army uniforms. [41] Two IAF helicopters were called to the scene in order to evacuate those wounded.
IDF medic Anastasia Bagdalov was awarded military commendation for her response to the attack. She was a passenger on the bus that was attacked by militants. Begdlov used her bra as a tourniquet on a severely wounded passenger's artery.
Around 18:30, an Israeli patrol was fired on from the Egyptian border as it searched for militants. Israeli troops returned fire, and the shooting lasted for about an hour. A sniper from the Yamam special police unit was critically wounded and later died. News of the firefight interrupted a briefing by the Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Chief of Staff Benny Gantz . [42] [43] [44]
According to an Egyptian probe, Israeli troops entered the Sinai Peninsula chasing after the terrorists, exchanging fire with Egyptian police, and an Israeli helicopter fired two rockets at the terrorists and machine guns at Egyptian security personnel, killing an Egyptian officer and two policemen. [2] In a later incident, first reported as a suicide bomb attack, [45] another two Egyptian soldiers were killed, presumably also by Israeli forces. [2] Some Israeli sources claimed that an IDF investigation said that the IDF's attack helicopters avoided hitting the Egyptian military and that it remains unclear who fired the deadly shots. [46]
The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries and lead to mass protests in Cairo outside the Israeli embassy. [47]
Following the attack, all roads to and from Eilat were sealed off and operations at Ovda Airport were suspended. Roadblocks were set up at the entrance to the city of Eilat, and the area was locked down. Magen David Adom (Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service) raised its alert level and began preparing teams of paramedics and medical equipment. The Israeli Air Force sent in Eilat police deployed a large number of security forces and a police war room was opened at the Yoseftal Medical Center . Seven of the 29 injured people who were brought to the Yoseftal Medical Center were later transferred to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba . [30] The police asked the public to expect roadblocks at the entrance to Eilat amidst a heavy police presence in the city; however later in the day they added that no security incidents were under way in either Eilat or Beersheba despite calling for public vigilance and for the public-at-large to contact police in case of any suspicious individuals or items.

Responsibility
According to SITE a group calling itself Ansar Jerusalem claimed responsibility for the attack. [61] Nevertheless, Israel stated that it possesses evidence that indicate that the attacks were orchestrated by the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) in Gaza. [7] [62]
The (PRC) denied any involvement in the attack, though they praised it. According to PRC spokesman, "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems ". [63] According to Haaretz, there is doubt in Gaza, that members of the Popular Resistance Committees were behind the attack. The Egyptian daily Al-Masry Al-Youm reported that Egyptian security forces identified three of those responsible for the attack as Egyptians. [64]
Hamas, which governs Gaza, also denied involvement. [65] Sky News quoted Hamas spokesman Taher al-Nunu as saying: "The Palestinian government denies the accusations made by Barak about the operation in Eilat and affirms that there is no relation between the Gaza Strip and what happened near Eilat." [66] Hamas did, however, "praise" the attack. [67]
The Washington Times reported that US intelligence agencies linked Al Qaeda to the attack, claiming that either the PRC or the Gaza-based Jaish al Islam carried out the attacks. [68]
Subsequent events
Casualties and losses None 14 Palestinians killed including at least 6 senior PRC militants; "scores" injured [69] [70]
At 18.00 the Israeli Air Force , [71] working with Shin Bet , [7] bombed a building used by Popular Resistance Committees' members in Rafah . Five PRC members were killed. Among the dead was the PRC's commander Kamal al-Nairab and military chief Immad Hammad, [72] [73] [74] who was suspected by Shin Bet of having planned the attacks. Of the remaining three, two were top members. [7] The two-year-old son of one of the militants, who was in the building when it was attacked, was also killed. [72] The airstrike occurred in the southern Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border. [75] [76] The PRC responded to the attack in saying that it vows "double" revenge. [7] Later, the Israeli Air Force launched a wave of attacks against targets in Gaza. A home near the former Palestinian intelligence headquarters was hit, reportedly killing one and wounding seventeen, and starting a large fire in the area. Israeli aircraft fired three missiles at a building used by Hamas security forces, and bombed a Hamas outpost in Khan Yunis . A missile was also fired at an open area in the southern Gaza Strip. Several targets were bombed in the northern Gaza Strip, including a building used by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades . Several targets were hit around the Philadelphi Route , believed to have been smuggling tunnels. [77] Numerous rocket-launching cells were attacked during the airstrikes. Three Palestinian militants were killed as they participated in the firing of rockets, and senior PRC member Samed Abdul Mu'ty Abed was killed while riding a motorcycle in northern Gaza. Another man was injured in the attack that killed Abed. [21] [78] [79]
The Israeli Air Force bombed two tunnels and one warehouse used for manufacturing weapons in southern Gaza and one site used for militant activities. The tunnels had been used to allow assailants to infiltrate Israel and carry out attacks according to a statement released by the IDF Spokesperson's Unit . The IAF identified direct hits, and all aircraft returned to Israel safely. [80] An airstrike in central Gaza targeting a car killed a Palestinian militant, his five-year-old son, and his brother. [73] [81]
On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed Zuhir al-Qaisi , the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks, and his collaborator, Mahmoud Hanani. [23]
Palestinian militant response to Israeli air strikes
After the Israeli Air Force attacked targets in the Gaza Strip, at least 10 rockets were fired into southern Israel, hitting the cities of Ashkelon and Beersheba , causing no injuries. [82] Two additional rockets landed in a courtyard of a Yeshiva in Ashdod , wounding 10 people and lightly damaging the buildings. [83] [84] The Abdullah Azzam Shaheed Brigade , a radical Islamic group affiliated with Al Qaeda , claimed responsibility for the attack. [85]
August 21st rocket attacks
Perpetrators
Over 80 rockets launched from Gaza hit cities in Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding over a dozen. [88] Seven rockets were fired almost simultaneously at Beersheba . The Iron Dome rocket defense system intercepted five of them, but one hit a residential area and killed Israeli Yossi Shushan. The Lachish subdistrict was hit by 28 rockets and the Negev subdistrict was hit by nine rockets. Four Israelis from the Bnei Shimon Regional Council were injured while running for shelter in Beersheba. Three Palestinians working in Israel were injured by Grad rockets after they exploded in a field in southern Ashdod . Vehicles and homes were damaged by rockets in Israeli cities near Gaza. [89] [90]
A Grad rocket exploded near the coastal city of Ashkelon in the night, though no injuries or damage were reported. It was unknown whether the rocket was intercepted by the Iron Dome , though it was confirmed that a second rocket was intercepted. [91] On August 21, an additional 12 rockets were fired at Israel. Three were intercepted by the Iron Dome in Ashkelon. One of the rockets hit an empty high school building in Beersheba. No one was in the school because "the city had canceled educational activities in light of the missile attacks that Palestinians in Gaza have been launching against the south in the last few days" according to Beersheba deputy mayor Heftziba Zohar. Later that night, a rocket killed a dog. [92] [93] [94]
Barrages of rockets were fired at Beersheba and Ashkelon. Half of them were intercepted by the Iron Dome . Mortar shells fired at farmland in the Eshkol Regional Council contained phosphorus , which is designed to create a more intense fire after detonation. [95] 40 rockets were fired on Sunday. [96] Several structures were damaged and a car caught fire after two rockets were fired at Ashkelon. A three-month-old infant was injured by glass splinters. [97]
A 13-year-old Palestinian boy, Mahmoud Abu Samra, was killed during the rocket attacks when a Palestinian Grad rocket fell short and landed in Gaza. [81]
An informal ceasefire was agreed upon between Israel and Hamas after the Arab League held an "urgent meeting" in Cairo on August 21, 2011. [98] Some 20 minutes after the ceasefire came into effect, a barrage of Qassam rockets and mortar shells was fired at Israel. The Iron Dome intercepted two rockets fired at Ashkelon. The Israeli Air Force attacked a militant cell in the northern Gaza Strip, wounding several people. The Islamic Jihad Movement and the Popular Resistance Committees said that they would not accept a ceasefire. [99]
On August 23, four Qassam rockets were fired at Israel in breach of the ceasefire. The rockets landed in open areas and caused no casualties, but one caused a brushfire which spread to an area near two civilian communities and threatened local greenhouses . Firefighters managed to contain the blaze before it did any damage. [100]
On August 24, more than 20 rockets were fired at Israeli communities. Grad rockets targeted the cities of Beersheba, Ashkelon, and Ofakim , injuring a nine-month-old baby. In Gaza, a senior Islamic Jihad member who funded the cross-border attacks was killed and two others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a car. Israeli jets also fired at two militants after they were seen preparing to fire rockets. Several hours after the strike, two mortar shells landed in the western Negev, causing no casualties. [101] Seven rockets were fired at Southern Israel, causing no damage or casualties. The Israeli Air Force attacked an Islamic Jihad rocket-launching cell, killing one militant. According to Palestinian media, the IDF fired shells at a militant squad in eastern Gaza after a rocket attack, but the cell escaped the strike. [102] On August 25, the Islamic Jihad Movement announced that it would abide by the ceasefire. The same day, 15 rockets and mortar shells hit Southern Israel, hitting open areas near Ashkelon and in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council . A mortar shell heavily damaged the Erez Crossing Terminal . Israel responded with airstrikes on several targets in the Gaza Strip. The two Islamic Jihad militants who had launched the mortar attack on the Erez Crossing were killed by an airstrike as traveled on their motorbike in northern Gaza. [103] On August 26, two Qassam rockets hit open areas in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council , and a Grad rocket exploded near Ashkelon. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility. [104]
Egyptian protests
On August 21, 2011, media reported that the Egyptian authorities were recalling the Egyptian ambassador in Israel in response to the killing of five Egyptian security officers by Israeli soldiers after the attacks near Eilat. [105] Egypt's foreign minister later stated that "at no point was there any intention on our part to recall our ambassador to Tel Aviv." [57]
Following the media reports about the killing of the Egyptian security officers, demonstrations against Israel erupted in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy. The demonstrators threw fire crackers at the building, unfurled a Palestinian flag, and called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in response to the killings. [11] Eventually a young Egyptian, Ahmed Al-Shahhat, climbed to the roof of the apartment building which houses the Israeli Embassy and removed the Israeli flag, replacing it with an Egyptian flag he had carried with him, becoming an instant folk hero in Egypt. The Israeli flag he had taken down was burned by protesters. [106] During the demonstrations which continued for several days, thousands of protesters, shouting anti Israel slogans, called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador, the recalling of Egyptian ambassador to Israel, a review of the Camp David Accords and the opening of the border with the Gaza Strip. [26] [107] On Friday, August 26, 2011, a demonstration announced as "Million-man demonstration to expel the Israeli ambassador" took place in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy, [108] drawing a few hundred protesters according to Haaretz . [109]
Israeli apology to Egypt
In October 2011, the New York Times reported that Israel had sent a letter of apology to Egypt for the killing of the Egyptian security officers by Israeli forces. [12]
Official reactions
Involved parties
 Israel:
President Shimon Peres said "The series of severe terror events are an attempt by terror organizations to murder innocent civilians within Israel, and to disrupt our lives" [110]
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that this was a "serious incident in which Israeli citizens were hurt and the country's sovereignty was harmed." [111] [112]
Defense Minister Ehud Barak stated "this is a grave terrorist incident in a number of locations. The incident reflects the weakness of Egypt's hold over Sinai and the spread of terrorist elements." [113] He also blamed the attacks on Gazans and pledged that Israel will respond. "The source of the terror incidents is Gaza and we will act against them with all our strength and determination." [114] He also expressed regret over the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers and ordered the IDF to conduct a military probe of the incident, and defense officials said it would likely be a joint probe with the participation of the Egyptian military. [13]
Palestinian Authority Chief-negotiator Saeb Erekat stated "Israel stands warned of any possible aggressive action or collective punishment measures against the Palestinian population in Gaza." Erekat stated that the Palestinian Authority is "against violence in all its forms," however, he added that such attacks should not be used by Israel as "a pretext for aggression."
Hamas denied responsibility for the attacks but praised the attacks "...since they were against soldiers." [115] Hamas warned Israel not to attack the Gaza Strip, following a statement by Defense Minister Ehud Barak that the IDF would strike back at the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza following a deadly triple terror attack. Hamas evacuated its command centers and sent senior commanders into hiding in anticipation of an IDF response. [116]
Popular Resistance Committee (PRC) spokesperson praised the attacks but said his group does not take any responsibility for launching it: "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems." [117]
Tawheed and Jihad , an al-Qaeda -linked group in the Gaza Strip, praised the attacks and said the "Jewish state should expect more." Over the internet, the group said "We in the Tawheed and Jihad group bless these blessed arms that pounded the fortifications of the vendetta-filled Jewish enemy in the so-called Eilat area in southern occupied Palestine." [118] [119]
Supranational
 United Nations – UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday strongly condemned the attack but called for restraint. According to a UN statement, "the secretary-general hopes that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and brought to justice. He is concerned at the risk of escalation and calls for all to act with restraint." [121]
 European Union – EU Chief Catherine Ashton condemned the attacks, and said "I have learned with deep concern of the series of terrorist attacks that has taken place in Southern Israel today, including against civilian targets, and in which several Israelis are reported to have lost their lives and many more to have been injured. I condemn unreservedly all such acts of terror, extend my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in these attacks and express my wishes for a full and speedy recovery to the injured." [122] [123]
The Middle East Quartet in a joint statement condemned the attacks and expressed concern "about the unsustainable situation in Gaza as well as the risk of escalation", and called for "restraint from all sides". [120]
International
 Bulgaria – The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks, saying: "We express our sincere condolences to the relatives of all victims. We are convinced that violence and terrorism cannot bring peace to the Middle East. Such acts do not help the efforts of the international community to bring the participants in the Middle East peace process back to the negotiations table." [124]
 Canada – Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird condemned the attacks, saying: “Canada condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in southern Israel today. These cowardly attacks, particularly on civilian targets, are abhorrent and criminal. On behalf of all Canadians, I send my heartfelt condolences to those affected by today’s vicious attacks.” Furthermore, Baird said: "“Israel has a right to defend itself against such terrorist acts in conformity with international humanitarian law. Those responsible for these horrific attacks must be held accountable.” [125]
 Costa Rica – The Ministry of Foreign Relations published an article condemning the attack, communicating its condolences to the people of Israel, specially to the victims and families of the murdered. The article stated that Costa Rica, as a peace loving country, respectful of all human rights, expresses its most energetic disapproval of any kind of violence or terrorist attacks, regardless of the motives behind it. [126]
 Germany – Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also condemned the attacks saying: "At this difficult hour we stand by the side of our Israeli friends. Those responsible must be prosecuted. Terror and violence must not be allowed to torpedo peace and negotiation efforts in the Middle East." [127]
 Italy – Italian Foreign Affairs Minister, Franco Frattini, condemned the "barbaric" attacks on southern Israel and warned the international community to prevent more such attacks due to the unrest in the Arab world. He said: "I would like to express my condolences and closeness to the Israeli people and government for the loss of life in the barbaric attacks today." [128]
 Netherlands – The Dutch Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms." [129]
 Norway – Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Gahr Støre "condemned in the strongest possible terms" the acts of terror, adding that Norway condemns all use of terror [130]
 United Kingdom – Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said that "I condemn these appalling and senseless acts of violence. As efforts for peace in the region continue, this brutality has no place, nor its perpetrators any excuse. My thoughts and prayers are with those killed and injured and I offer sincere condolences to their families and friends."
 USA – The State Department condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms," calling the attack "brutal and cowardly." Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said "We hope that those involved in the planning of these gruesome attacks will be brought to swift justice. We stand by Israel as our friend, partner, and ally – now and always." [131] She also added that "This violence only underscores our strong concerns about the security situation in the Sinai Peninsula. Recent commitments by the Egyptian government to address the security situation in the Sinai are important and we urge the Egyptian government to find a lasting resolution." [132]
 Russia – Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman by telephone. Lavrov expressed his condolences over the terrorist attacks in southern Israel. He condemned this extremist act, and "reaffirmed the immutable position of Russia that there can be no justification for terror or for those who use it as means to achieve their ends". He also said that "despite the gravity of the crime, it is necessary to exercise restraint and to avoid retaliatory steps from which innocent people may suffer". [133]
Impact
Following the attacks on Highway 12, Israel is reportedly to soon allow Egypt to deploy thousands of troops in the Sinai Peninsula in violation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, in which both countries agreed that the Sinai Peninsula will be a military-free zone. [15]
Investigation
According to Haaretz, the IDF General Staff's investigation into the attack “was a source of great frustration”. An intelligence alert from the Shin Bet had led to a massive deployment of IDF troops in the area, but the forces' alertness had eroded, allowing the militants to track the IDF and choose their infiltration route. The decision not to close the road on the morning of the attack in spite of warnings from the Shin Beth is characterised as “understandable error of judgment, and definitely not a manifestation of carelessness”, whereas the appearance of the defense minister and the chief of staff at the scene of the incident while terrorists were still in the area is considered a serious security blunder that nearly culminated in another disaster.

The first part works amazing: people all over the world collaborating to create the world's largest encyclopedia.
The second part – well, it seems that people are not as cooperative when it comes to their wallets: Wikipedia's budget is very limited, resulting in a website that looks more like a private blog than the world's 6th largest site (I mean, images that open in a new page? Really?)
QuickiWiki allows people to access Wikipedia's content through a quicker and more modern interface, enhancing it with images, videos and more (How about being able to play the movie trailer from within the film's page?)
Hey! Aren't you stealing Wikipedia's work?
Quite the opposite. Wikimedia (the awesome people behind Wikipedia) have made all its content free and available to all humankind.

2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks
Site of the attacks
Deaths
6 Israeli civilians, 1 Israeli soldier, 1 Israeli Yamam policeman, 5 Egyptian soldiers, 10 attackers [2]
Non-fatal injuries
Perpetrators
Presumably 12 assailants. Israel has stated that the attacks were orchestrated by the Gaza based Popular Resistance Committees , who deny involvement. [4] Egyptian sources report that three of the attackers were Sinai-based Egyptians. [2] [5]
On August 18, 2011, a series of cross-border attacks with parallel attacks and mutual cover was carried out in southern Israel on Highway 12 near the Egyptian border by a squad of presumably 12 militants in four groups. [2] The attacks occurred after Israel's interior security service Shin Bet had warned of an attack by militants in the region and Israeli troops had been stationed in the area. [6] The militants first opened fire at an Egged No. 392 bus as it was traveling on Highway 12 in the Negev near Eilat . [3] [7] Several minutes later, a bomb was detonated next to an Israeli army patrol along Israel's border with Egypt. In a third attack, an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians. [8] Eight Israelis – six civilians, one Yamam special unit police sniper and one Golani Brigade soldier—were killed in the multiple-stage attack. [9] [10] The Israel Defense Forces reported eight attackers killed, and Egyptian security forces reported killing another two. [2]
Five Egyptian soldiers were also killed. According to Egypt, they were killed by Israeli security forces chasing militants across the Egyptian border, while an Israeli military officer initially said they were killed by a suicide bomber who had fled across the border into Egypt. [11] The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between Egypt and Israel and led to mass protests outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo. According to media reports, Egypt threatened to withdraw its ambassador to Israel, but Egypt's foreign minister later denied this. [2] Israel expressed regret over the deaths, and sent a letter of apology to Egypt. [12] The IDF was ordered to conduct a military probe of the incident, [13] [14] and on August 25, 2011, Israel agreed to a joint investigation with Egypt of the events. [15]
The identity of the attackers, three of whom were reportedly Egyptian, [16] is not widely agreed upon, [17] and so far no group took responsibility for the attacks. The Israeli government accused the Palestinian Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), a Gaza -based coalition of Palestinian militant groups, of orchestrating the attacks, [18] but the PRC denies involvement. [19] However, Israel attacked seven targets in the Gaza Strip immediately after the terror attacks in the Negev, killing five members of the PRC, including its leader. [20]
On August 21, 2011, an informal ceasefire was called by Israel and Hamas after days of escalating violence in which fifteen Palestinians were killed and many were wounded. More than 100 rockets and mortar shells were fired from Gaza into Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding more than a dozen. [21] The ceasefire was broken almost immediately by rocket fire from Gaza on southern Israel, followed by retaliatory Israeli airstrikes, killing at least seven Palestinians, among them two leaders of the Islamic Jihad . On August 26, 2011, Gaza militants called a second truce. [22] On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , Zuhir al-Qaisi , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks. [23]

Egypt–Israel border north of Eilat near where the attacks took place. Egypt is on the left, Israel on the right.
The southern part of Israeli Highway 12 runs adjacent to Israel's border with Egypt. It was the scene of previous shooting attacks in the 1990s.[ citation needed ] In the late 2000s, the Israeli government decided to build the Israel–Egypt barrier , although by 2011 only 10% of it had been completed, none close to the site of the attack. [24]
Following the 2011 Egyptian revolution militant organizations increased their activity in the Sinai Peninsula and Al-Qaeda militants groups were established, [25] after Egyptian police had all but completely withdrawn from the northern Sinai, dominated by Bedouin tribes. During the months preceding the cross-border attacks, Egypt reinforced its forces with about 1,000 additional soldiers in the Sinai Peninsula, with the consent of Israel, after a series of five bombings had disrupted the flow of natural gas to Israel. [26]
On July 30, militants staged an attack on an Egyptian police station in El-Arish, killing six. [27]
On August 2, a group claiming to be the Sinai wing of Al Qaeda declared its intention to create an Islamic caliphate in the Sinai. [28]
On August 14, 2011, Egyptian forces swept the Sinai Peninsula in search of terror cells. [29] Jordanian intelligence informed the Israelis that they had information about an impending terror attack in the south of Israel. [30] Two days prior to the attack, the Egyptian army captured four Islamist insurgents as they prepared to blow up a gas pipeline in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula. [31]
Israeli interior security service Shin Bet had warned of terrorist attacks being planned in the region in an area 80 kilometers long, presuming that they would take place at night. The warnings led to a massive deployment of IDF troops, [6] and the closing of Highway 12, which was reopened only on the day of the attack at the order of head of IDF's southern command Tal Russo . [32]
August 18 cross-border attacks and immediate Israeli response
The original attacks occurred in three coordinated stages. [8] They were carried out by 12 militants in four groups dispersed over an area 12 kilometers long. At least some of the attackers wore brown uniforms, similar to those used by the Egyptian Army . [2] Israeli military and police forces, in cooperation with Shin Bet , began pursuing the perpetrators immediately after the attacks commenced and locked down the area. [33]
The attacks commenced around 12:00 pm (UTC+2) near the Ein Netafim spring, on Highway 12 from Mitzpe Ramon to Eilat , when three militants spread out about 200 meters from one another, [10] armed with suicide bomb vests, grenades , RPGs , and machine guns opened fire on an Egged passenger bus on line 392, carrying mostly soldiers but also some civilians. [8] Seven passengers were wounded, most of them soldiers. [34] According to eyewitnesses, a white car was following the bus, and a group of people dressed in military uniforms got out and opened fire. The bus driver, Benny Belevsky, did not stop the bus and sped away, getting to an IDF post near the Netafim Border Crossing . [35]
The militants, dressed in brown uniforms resembling those of the Egyptian Army, then began attacking passing vehicles, waving white handkerchiefs to fool motorists. [2] One of the militants attacked a bus that drove by and detonated the suicide bomb belt he was wearing, killing himself and the bus driver, who had stopped the empty bus. [34] Another militant opened fire at a passing car and killed the female driver. The same militant then fired an RPG at an Israeli Air Force helicopter, but missed. An IDF jeep from the Golani Brigade then arrived at the scene and ran over the militant, killing him. [10] Another Golani Brigade jeep arrived, and ran over a roadside bomb. As the soldiers exited the damaged vehicle, the surviving militant opened fire at them. Soldiers and Yamam special police officers then located the militant and killed him in a gunbattle. Two other militants then opened fire at the from Egyptian territory. Israeli forces briefly crossed the border and killed both of the militants. One Israeli soldier was killed by friendly fire during the engagement and several soldiers were wounded. [36] [37] [38] [39] The Egyptian Army informed the IDF that its soldiers killed two more militants in the Sinai. [10]
In the third attack, which occurred around 12:35, mortar shells were fired at soldiers carrying out routine maintenance work at the security fence constructed along the border between Israel and Egypt. No one was hurt in the attack. [33] [40]
Around 13:30, not far from the first shooting incident, militants opened fire, including with an anti-tank missile , at a bus and private car on route 90, a desert road near the border with Jordan . According to medics, five people were killed in the attacks. [7] Seven people were wounded when another private vehicle was hit by an anti-tank missile. Eyewitnesses suggested that some of the attackers may have been wearing Egyptian Army uniforms. [41] Two IAF helicopters were called to the scene in order to evacuate those wounded.
IDF medic Anastasia Bagdalov was awarded military commendation for her response to the attack. She was a passenger on the bus that was attacked by militants. Begdlov used her bra as a tourniquet on a severely wounded passenger's artery.
Around 18:30, an Israeli patrol was fired on from the Egyptian border as it searched for militants. Israeli troops returned fire, and the shooting lasted for about an hour. A sniper from the Yamam special police unit was critically wounded and later died. News of the firefight interrupted a briefing by the Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Chief of Staff Benny Gantz . [42] [43] [44]
According to an Egyptian probe, Israeli troops entered the Sinai Peninsula chasing after the terrorists, exchanging fire with Egyptian police, and an Israeli helicopter fired two rockets at the terrorists and machine guns at Egyptian security personnel, killing an Egyptian officer and two policemen. [2] In a later incident, first reported as a suicide bomb attack, [45] another two Egyptian soldiers were killed, presumably also by Israeli forces. [2] Some Israeli sources claimed that an IDF investigation said that the IDF's attack helicopters avoided hitting the Egyptian military and that it remains unclear who fired the deadly shots. [46]
The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries and lead to mass protests in Cairo outside the Israeli embassy. [47]
Following the attack, all roads to and from Eilat were sealed off and operations at Ovda Airport were suspended. Roadblocks were set up at the entrance to the city of Eilat, and the area was locked down. Magen David Adom (Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service) raised its alert level and began preparing teams of paramedics and medical equipment. The Israeli Air Force sent in Eilat police deployed a large number of security forces and a police war room was opened at the Yoseftal Medical Center . Seven of the 29 injured people who were brought to the Yoseftal Medical Center were later transferred to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba . [30] The police asked the public to expect roadblocks at the entrance to Eilat amidst a heavy police presence in the city; however later in the day they added that no security incidents were under way in either Eilat or Beersheba despite calling for public vigilance and for the public-at-large to contact police in case of any suspicious individuals or items.

Responsibility
According to SITE a group calling itself Ansar Jerusalem claimed responsibility for the attack. [61] Nevertheless, Israel stated that it possesses evidence that indicate that the attacks were orchestrated by the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) in Gaza. [7] [62]
The (PRC) denied any involvement in the attack, though they praised it. According to PRC spokesman, "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems ". [63] According to Haaretz, there is doubt in Gaza, that members of the Popular Resistance Committees were behind the attack. The Egyptian daily Al-Masry Al-Youm reported that Egyptian security forces identified three of those responsible for the attack as Egyptians. [64]
Hamas, which governs Gaza, also denied involvement. [65] Sky News quoted Hamas spokesman Taher al-Nunu as saying: "The Palestinian government denies the accusations made by Barak about the operation in Eilat and affirms that there is no relation between the Gaza Strip and what happened near Eilat." [66] Hamas did, however, "praise" the attack. [67]
The Washington Times reported that US intelligence agencies linked Al Qaeda to the attack, claiming that either the PRC or the Gaza-based Jaish al Islam carried out the attacks. [68]
Subsequent events
Casualties and losses None 14 Palestinians killed including at least 6 senior PRC militants; "scores" injured [69] [70]
At 18.00 the Israeli Air Force , [71] working with Shin Bet , [7] bombed a building used by Popular Resistance Committees' members in Rafah . Five PRC members were killed. Among the dead was the PRC's commander Kamal al-Nairab and military chief Immad Hammad, [72] [73] [74] who was suspected by Shin Bet of having planned the attacks. Of the remaining three, two were top members. [7] The two-year-old son of one of the militants, who was in the building when it was attacked, was also killed. [72] The airstrike occurred in the southern Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border. [75] [76] The PRC responded to the attack in saying that it vows "double" revenge. [7] Later, the Israeli Air Force launched a wave of attacks against targets in Gaza. A home near the former Palestinian intelligence headquarters was hit, reportedly killing one and wounding seventeen, and starting a large fire in the area. Israeli aircraft fired three missiles at a building used by Hamas security forces, and bombed a Hamas outpost in Khan Yunis . A missile was also fired at an open area in the southern Gaza Strip. Several targets were bombed in the northern Gaza Strip, including a building used by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades . Several targets were hit around the Philadelphi Route , believed to have been smuggling tunnels. [77] Numerous rocket-launching cells were attacked during the airstrikes. Three Palestinian militants were killed as they participated in the firing of rockets, and senior PRC member Samed Abdul Mu'ty Abed was killed while riding a motorcycle in northern Gaza. Another man was injured in the attack that killed Abed. [21] [78] [79]
The Israeli Air Force bombed two tunnels and one warehouse used for manufacturing weapons in southern Gaza and one site used for militant activities. The tunnels had been used to allow assailants to infiltrate Israel and carry out attacks according to a statement released by the IDF Spokesperson's Unit . The IAF identified direct hits, and all aircraft returned to Israel safely. [80] An airstrike in central Gaza targeting a car killed a Palestinian militant, his five-year-old son, and his brother. [73] [81]
On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed Zuhir al-Qaisi , the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks, and his collaborator, Mahmoud Hanani. [23]
Palestinian militant response to Israeli air strikes
After the Israeli Air Force attacked targets in the Gaza Strip, at least 10 rockets were fired into southern Israel, hitting the cities of Ashkelon and Beersheba , causing no injuries. [82] Two additional rockets landed in a courtyard of a Yeshiva in Ashdod , wounding 10 people and lightly damaging the buildings. [83] [84] The Abdullah Azzam Shaheed Brigade , a radical Islamic group affiliated with Al Qaeda , claimed responsibility for the attack. [85]
August 21st rocket attacks
Perpetrators
Over 80 rockets launched from Gaza hit cities in Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding over a dozen. [88] Seven rockets were fired almost simultaneously at Beersheba . The Iron Dome rocket defense system intercepted five of them, but one hit a residential area and killed Israeli Yossi Shushan. The Lachish subdistrict was hit by 28 rockets and the Negev subdistrict was hit by nine rockets. Four Israelis from the Bnei Shimon Regional Council were injured while running for shelter in Beersheba. Three Palestinians working in Israel were injured by Grad rockets after they exploded in a field in southern Ashdod . Vehicles and homes were damaged by rockets in Israeli cities near Gaza. [89] [90]
A Grad rocket exploded near the coastal city of Ashkelon in the night, though no injuries or damage were reported. It was unknown whether the rocket was intercepted by the Iron Dome , though it was confirmed that a second rocket was intercepted. [91] On August 21, an additional 12 rockets were fired at Israel. Three were intercepted by the Iron Dome in Ashkelon. One of the rockets hit an empty high school building in Beersheba. No one was in the school because "the city had canceled educational activities in light of the missile attacks that Palestinians in Gaza have been launching against the south in the last few days" according to Beersheba deputy mayor Heftziba Zohar. Later that night, a rocket killed a dog. [92] [93] [94]
Barrages of rockets were fired at Beersheba and Ashkelon. Half of them were intercepted by the Iron Dome . Mortar shells fired at farmland in the Eshkol Regional Council contained phosphorus , which is designed to create a more intense fire after detonation. [95] 40 rockets were fired on Sunday. [96] Several structures were damaged and a car caught fire after two rockets were fired at Ashkelon. A three-month-old infant was injured by glass splinters. [97]
A 13-year-old Palestinian boy, Mahmoud Abu Samra, was killed during the rocket attacks when a Palestinian Grad rocket fell short and landed in Gaza. [81]
An informal ceasefire was agreed upon between Israel and Hamas after the Arab League held an "urgent meeting" in Cairo on August 21, 2011. [98] Some 20 minutes after the ceasefire came into effect, a barrage of Qassam rockets and mortar shells was fired at Israel. The Iron Dome intercepted two rockets fired at Ashkelon. The Israeli Air Force attacked a militant cell in the northern Gaza Strip, wounding several people. The Islamic Jihad Movement and the Popular Resistance Committees said that they would not accept a ceasefire. [99]
On August 23, four Qassam rockets were fired at Israel in breach of the ceasefire. The rockets landed in open areas and caused no casualties, but one caused a brushfire which spread to an area near two civilian communities and threatened local greenhouses . Firefighters managed to contain the blaze before it did any damage. [100]
On August 24, more than 20 rockets were fired at Israeli communities. Grad rockets targeted the cities of Beersheba, Ashkelon, and Ofakim , injuring a nine-month-old baby. In Gaza, a senior Islamic Jihad member who funded the cross-border attacks was killed and two others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a car. Israeli jets also fired at two militants after they were seen preparing to fire rockets. Several hours after the strike, two mortar shells landed in the western Negev, causing no casualties. [101] Seven rockets were fired at Southern Israel, causing no damage or casualties. The Israeli Air Force attacked an Islamic Jihad rocket-launching cell, killing one militant. According to Palestinian media, the IDF fired shells at a militant squad in eastern Gaza after a rocket attack, but the cell escaped the strike. [102] On August 25, the Islamic Jihad Movement announced that it would abide by the ceasefire. The same day, 15 rockets and mortar shells hit Southern Israel, hitting open areas near Ashkelon and in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council . A mortar shell heavily damaged the Erez Crossing Terminal . Israel responded with airstrikes on several targets in the Gaza Strip. The two Islamic Jihad militants who had launched the mortar attack on the Erez Crossing were killed by an airstrike as traveled on their motorbike in northern Gaza. [103] On August 26, two Qassam rockets hit open areas in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council , and a Grad rocket exploded near Ashkelon. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility. [104]
Egyptian protests
On August 21, 2011, media reported that the Egyptian authorities were recalling the Egyptian ambassador in Israel in response to the killing of five Egyptian security officers by Israeli soldiers after the attacks near Eilat. [105] Egypt's foreign minister later stated that "at no point was there any intention on our part to recall our ambassador to Tel Aviv." [57]
Following the media reports about the killing of the Egyptian security officers, demonstrations against Israel erupted in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy. The demonstrators threw fire crackers at the building, unfurled a Palestinian flag, and called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in response to the killings. [11] Eventually a young Egyptian, Ahmed Al-Shahhat, climbed to the roof of the apartment building which houses the Israeli Embassy and removed the Israeli flag, replacing it with an Egyptian flag he had carried with him, becoming an instant folk hero in Egypt. The Israeli flag he had taken down was burned by protesters. [106] During the demonstrations which continued for several days, thousands of protesters, shouting anti Israel slogans, called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador, the recalling of Egyptian ambassador to Israel, a review of the Camp David Accords and the opening of the border with the Gaza Strip. [26] [107] On Friday, August 26, 2011, a demonstration announced as "Million-man demonstration to expel the Israeli ambassador" took place in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy, [108] drawing a few hundred protesters according to Haaretz . [109]
Israeli apology to Egypt
In October 2011, the New York Times reported that Israel had sent a letter of apology to Egypt for the killing of the Egyptian security officers by Israeli forces. [12]
Official reactions
Involved parties
 Israel:
President Shimon Peres said "The series of severe terror events are an attempt by terror organizations to murder innocent civilians within Israel, and to disrupt our lives" [110]
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that this was a "serious incident in which Israeli citizens were hurt and the country's sovereignty was harmed." [111] [112]
Defense Minister Ehud Barak stated "this is a grave terrorist incident in a number of locations. The incident reflects the weakness of Egypt's hold over Sinai and the spread of terrorist elements." [113] He also blamed the attacks on Gazans and pledged that Israel will respond. "The source of the terror incidents is Gaza and we will act against them with all our strength and determination." [114] He also expressed regret over the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers and ordered the IDF to conduct a military probe of the incident, and defense officials said it would likely be a joint probe with the participation of the Egyptian military. [13]
Palestinian Authority Chief-negotiator Saeb Erekat stated "Israel stands warned of any possible aggressive action or collective punishment measures against the Palestinian population in Gaza." Erekat stated that the Palestinian Authority is "against violence in all its forms," however, he added that such attacks should not be used by Israel as "a pretext for aggression."
Hamas denied responsibility for the attacks but praised the attacks "...since they were against soldiers." [115] Hamas warned Israel not to attack the Gaza Strip, following a statement by Defense Minister Ehud Barak that the IDF would strike back at the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza following a deadly triple terror attack. Hamas evacuated its command centers and sent senior commanders into hiding in anticipation of an IDF response. [116]
Popular Resistance Committee (PRC) spokesperson praised the attacks but said his group does not take any responsibility for launching it: "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems." [117]
Tawheed and Jihad , an al-Qaeda -linked group in the Gaza Strip, praised the attacks and said the "Jewish state should expect more." Over the internet, the group said "We in the Tawheed and Jihad group bless these blessed arms that pounded the fortifications of the vendetta-filled Jewish enemy in the so-called Eilat area in southern occupied Palestine." [118] [119]
Supranational
 United Nations – UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday strongly condemned the attack but called for restraint. According to a UN statement, "the secretary-general hopes that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and brought to justice. He is concerned at the risk of escalation and calls for all to act with restraint." [121]
 European Union – EU Chief Catherine Ashton condemned the attacks, and said "I have learned with deep concern of the series of terrorist attacks that has taken place in Southern Israel today, including against civilian targets, and in which several Israelis are reported to have lost their lives and many more to have been injured. I condemn unreservedly all such acts of terror, extend my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in these attacks and express my wishes for a full and speedy recovery to the injured." [122] [123]
The Middle East Quartet in a joint statement condemned the attacks and expressed concern "about the unsustainable situation in Gaza as well as the risk of escalation", and called for "restraint from all sides". [120]
International
 Bulgaria – The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks, saying: "We express our sincere condolences to the relatives of all victims. We are convinced that violence and terrorism cannot bring peace to the Middle East. Such acts do not help the efforts of the international community to bring the participants in the Middle East peace process back to the negotiations table." [124]
 Canada – Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird condemned the attacks, saying: “Canada condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in southern Israel today. These cowardly attacks, particularly on civilian targets, are abhorrent and criminal. On behalf of all Canadians, I send my heartfelt condolences to those affected by today’s vicious attacks.” Furthermore, Baird said: "“Israel has a right to defend itself against such terrorist acts in conformity with international humanitarian law. Those responsible for these horrific attacks must be held accountable.” [125]
 Costa Rica – The Ministry of Foreign Relations published an article condemning the attack, communicating its condolences to the people of Israel, specially to the victims and families of the murdered. The article stated that Costa Rica, as a peace loving country, respectful of all human rights, expresses its most energetic disapproval of any kind of violence or terrorist attacks, regardless of the motives behind it. [126]
 Germany – Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also condemned the attacks saying: "At this difficult hour we stand by the side of our Israeli friends. Those responsible must be prosecuted. Terror and violence must not be allowed to torpedo peace and negotiation efforts in the Middle East." [127]
 Italy – Italian Foreign Affairs Minister, Franco Frattini, condemned the "barbaric" attacks on southern Israel and warned the international community to prevent more such attacks due to the unrest in the Arab world. He said: "I would like to express my condolences and closeness to the Israeli people and government for the loss of life in the barbaric attacks today." [128]
 Netherlands – The Dutch Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms." [129]
 Norway – Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Gahr Støre "condemned in the strongest possible terms" the acts of terror, adding that Norway condemns all use of terror [130]
 United Kingdom – Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said that "I condemn these appalling and senseless acts of violence. As efforts for peace in the region continue, this brutality has no place, nor its perpetrators any excuse. My thoughts and prayers are with those killed and injured and I offer sincere condolences to their families and friends."
 USA – The State Department condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms," calling the attack "brutal and cowardly." Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said "We hope that those involved in the planning of these gruesome attacks will be brought to swift justice. We stand by Israel as our friend, partner, and ally – now and always." [131] She also added that "This violence only underscores our strong concerns about the security situation in the Sinai Peninsula. Recent commitments by the Egyptian government to address the security situation in the Sinai are important and we urge the Egyptian government to find a lasting resolution." [132]
 Russia – Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman by telephone. Lavrov expressed his condolences over the terrorist attacks in southern Israel. He condemned this extremist act, and "reaffirmed the immutable position of Russia that there can be no justification for terror or for those who use it as means to achieve their ends". He also said that "despite the gravity of the crime, it is necessary to exercise restraint and to avoid retaliatory steps from which innocent people may suffer". [133]
Impact
Following the attacks on Highway 12, Israel is reportedly to soon allow Egypt to deploy thousands of troops in the Sinai Peninsula in violation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, in which both countries agreed that the Sinai Peninsula will be a military-free zone. [15]
Investigation
According to Haaretz, the IDF General Staff's investigation into the attack “was a source of great frustration”. An intelligence alert from the Shin Bet had led to a massive deployment of IDF troops in the area, but the forces' alertness had eroded, allowing the militants to track the IDF and choose their infiltration route. The decision not to close the road on the morning of the attack in spite of warnings from the Shin Beth is characterised as “understandable error of judgment, and definitely not a manifestation of carelessness”, whereas the appearance of the defense minister and the chief of staff at the scene of the incident while terrorists were still in the area is considered a serious security blunder that nearly culminated in another disaster. [6]

2011 Dera Ghazi Khan bombings - Wikipedia, the free ... 3 April 2011 Dera Ghazi Khan bombing; Location: Dera Ghazi Khan District, Punjab, Pakistan: Coordinates Coordinates: Date: 3 April 2011 ... Location
‡ indicates attacks resulting in more than 100 deaths
Underline indicates the deadliest terrorist attack/s to date
Contents
The attack was a double suicide bombing that left more than 50 people dead, as well as 120 wounded. [1] The bombings occurred while thousands of devotees were gathered for the annual Urs celebrations at the shrine. Urs are an integral part of South Asian Muslim culture and are held to mark the death anniversary of a Sufi. At around 5 pm PST , a teenaged bomber detonated his explosives while devotees were performing a mystical devotional dance at the main entrance to the building. Many of those wounded were in a critical condition. Approximately fifteen minutes later, a second suicide bomber also struck at the staircase of the shrine. A witness reported: "Bodies were scattered all over and the injured people were crying for help." [1]
According to police officials, both the bombers tried to enter the shrine but being unsuccessful, blew themselves up on the entrance. A third suicide bomber was also recognized and arrested; [3] While people were running in panic, the bomber by chance ran into an elderly woman and a hand grenade dropped from his hand.

Following the explosion, a state of emergency was declared and victims were shifted to various hospitals in Dera Ghazi Khan and nearby Multan . The death toll mounted as several people succumbed to their injuries in the various hospitals. [6]
It is said[ by whom? ] that the shrine had previously received threats from unknown militants. The Pakistani Taliban later claimed responsibility for the attacks. [2]
The shrine reopened the following day. [7]
Two days after the attack, the police claimed that it had identified the masterminds behind the bombing and that arrests were about to be carried out. According to investigators, the planning for the bombing had been carried out in the Bajaur Agency in the tribal areas along the Afghan border. [8] Two of the suicide bombers were from North Waziristan ; they had received their vests from handlers based in Dera Ismail Khan and later travelled to Dera Ghazi Khan, booking themselves a room at a hotel. [8] Umar, who failed to detonate his explosives, told interrogators that he had been told he would be granted paradise if he conducted the attack. He referred to himself as a " Fida'i " (meaning one who sacrifices their life for a cause), a term which militants often use for suicide bombers. When questioned how he would get into paradise by attacking people, he replied: "I don’t know about that but paradise must be better than this world." [8]
A statement from the office of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani condemned the blast, stating "such cowardly acts of terror clearly demonstrate that the culprits involved neither have any faith nor any belief in human values. Such violent acts only seem to be conspiracy to divide the society and create fear." [1]

The attack was a double suicide bombing that left more than 50 people dead, as well as 120 wounded.

Possible correction of Location and Coordinates[ edit ]
{{geodata-check}} Could someone please verify the correct location for this incident? The current Location may be confusing the "Dera Ghazi Khan" city with the district of the same name. And therefore the current Coordinates might be wrong as well.
The page's Reference no. 1 (The Express Tribune) writes "at the shrine, sited some 40 kilometres away from Dera Ghazi Khan city", and the page's reference no. 2 (telegraph.co.uk) writes "13th century Sufi saint Ahmed Sultan, popularly known as Sakhi Sarwar, in Dera Ghazi Khan district".
When I use Google Maps to search for the string "Sakhi Sarwar shrine in Dera Ghazi Khan, Punjab Province, Pakistan", I get 29°59′12″N 70°18′08″E﻿ / ﻿29.98656°N 70.30213°E﻿ / 29.98656; 70.30213 , which is also marked on Google Maps with an icon and title as "Sakhi Sarwar's shrine".
And finally, the page's reference no. 7 is a newspaper article apparently written by a journalist stationed at Dera Ghazi Khan city, but says of the incident that it took place "at Darbar Sakhi Sarwar, some 35 kilometres from here" -- and according to Google Maps, 35 kilometers is the distance from Dera Ghazi Khan city westwards to the Sakhi Sarwar shrine.
If my assumption is correct, then the problem is that the Location and Coordinates on the current version of the page seem to refer to the Dera Ghazi Khan city itself.
So, could someone please verify that this page should be corrected to the Location of "Sakhi Sarwar shrine in Dera Ghazi Khan _district_, Punjab Province, Pakistan" and the Coordinates of 29°59′12″N 70°18′08″E﻿ / ﻿29.98656°N 70.30213°E﻿ / 29.98656; 70.30213  ?
(By the way, if my assumption is correct, then there's another edit that should also be made in another page, i.e. the page for "Sakhi_Sarwar", section Incidents, which also points to the city itself -- with the phrase "In nearby Dera Ghazi Khan"...)
Done After reviewing your evidence and other evidence, I've concluded that your analysis is spot on. In addition to the points you've adduced, note that the entrance building of the shrine (clearly visible in the Bing aerial view), the coordinates of which I've used, appears to match the building shown in the photo in reference 7. I've made the necessary changes in both this article and Sakhi Sarwar . Deor ( talk ) 11:35, 6 November 2013 (UTC)

What is QuickiWiki?
QuickiWiki takes the amazing Wikipedia content and presents it to users using the latest technologies.
Why?
Wikipedia is based on community contributions and financial donations.
The first part works amazing: people all over the world collaborating to create the world's largest encyclopedia.
The second part – well, it seems that people are not as cooperative when it comes to their wallets: Wikipedia's budget is very limited, resulting in a website that looks more like a private blog than the world's 6th largest site (I mean, images that open in a new page? Really?)
QuickiWiki allows people to access Wikipedia's content through a quicker and more modern interface, enhancing it with images, videos and more (How about being able to play the movie trailer from within the film's page?)
Hey! Aren't you stealing Wikipedia's work?
Quite the opposite. Wikimedia (the awesome people behind Wikipedia) have made all its content free and available to all humankind.
Actually, by using QuickiWiki you are reducing load from Wikipedia's servers and saving them money!

2011 Dera Ghazi Khan bombings
Location
2 bombers, another one arrested [3]
A pair of bombings occurred on 3 April 2011 in a Sufi shrine dedicated to a 13th-century Sufi saint, Ahmed Sultan, located near the city of Dera Ghazi Khan in the southern region of Pakistan 's largest province, Punjab . [1]
Contents
Background
Sufism is a Muslim culture that has thrived in the Indian subcontinent and involves the belief that one can feel a linked connection with God through spirituality. In Pakistan, the Punjab region has been a historical hub of Sufi culture. Sufism and Sufi traditions are regarded as heretical by hard-line Islamists. In Sufi shrines devotees pray to saints while singing and dancing and this is considered un-Islamic by the Taliban . Several Sufi shrines in Pakistan have been targeted in the past by the Taliban. [4]
Attack
The attack was a double suicide bombing that left more than 50 people dead, as well as 120 wounded. [1] The bombings occurred while thousands of devotees were gathered for the annual Urs celebrations at the shrine. Urs are an integral part of South Asian Muslim culture and are held to mark the death anniversary of a Sufi. At around 5 pm PST , a teenaged bomber detonated his explosives while devotees were performing a mystical devotional dance at the main entrance to the building. Many of those wounded were in a critical condition. Approximately fifteen minutes later, a second suicide bomber also struck at the staircase of the shrine. A witness reported: "Bodies were scattered all over and the injured people were crying for help." [1]
According to police officials, both the bombers tried to enter the shrine but being unsuccessful, blew themselves up on the entrance. A third suicide bomber was also recognized and arrested; [3] While people were running in panic, the bomber by chance ran into an elderly woman and a hand grenade dropped from his hand. [1] The woman signaled alarm and nearby security officials opened fire on him which left him wounded. The attempted suicide bomber was identified as Umar or "Fida Hussain", a teenager Afghan refugee hailing from the tribal areas in northwest Pakistan. [1] He writhed on the ground while people took away his equipment. [5]
Aftermath
Following the explosion, a state of emergency was declared and victims were shifted to various hospitals in Dera Ghazi Khan and nearby Multan . The death toll mounted as several people succumbed to their injuries in the various hospitals. [6]
It is said[ by whom? ] that the shrine had previously received threats from unknown militants. The Pakistani Taliban later claimed responsibility for the attacks. [2]
The shrine reopened the following day. [7]
Investigations
Two days after the attack, the police claimed that it had identified the masterminds behind the bombing and that arrests were about to be carried out. According to investigators, the planning for the bombing had been carried out in the Bajaur Agency in the tribal areas along the Afghan border. [8] Two of the suicide bombers were from North Waziristan ; they had received their vests from handlers based in Dera Ismail Khan and later travelled to Dera Ghazi Khan, booking themselves a room at a hotel. [8] Umar, who failed to detonate his explosives, told interrogators that he had been told he would be granted paradise if he conducted the attack. He referred to himself as a " Fida'i " (meaning one who sacrifices their life for a cause), a term which militants often use for suicide bombers. When questioned how he would get into paradise by attacking people, he replied: "I don’t know about that but paradise must be better than this world." [8]
Response
A statement from the office of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani condemned the blast, stating "such cowardly acts of terror clearly demonstrate that the culprits involved neither have any faith nor any belief in human values. Such violent acts only seem to be conspiracy to divide the society and create fear." [1]

Hmm... the NYT article has changed some since I looked at it last. I changed the citation to another source, which says the same thing. Courcelles ( talk ) 16:51, 20 April 2010 (UTC)

May 2010 Kabul bombing
Contents
President Hamid Karzai had recently returned from a trip to US to gather support for his policy to promote peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan. A jirga was planned to discuss methods to promote peace with the tribal elders. Also a military offensive was being planned in the Kandahar Province . Shortly before this attack Taliban had announced 'Operation al-Fatah' that would target NATO forces, foreign diplomats, contractors and Afghan government. [3] Afghan police had set up several extra security checkpoints this year. In spite of these measures the bomber was able to drive his vehicle into the city. [1]
The bomber, driving a Toyota minivan packed with more than 1600 pounds of explosives, drove into a convoy of American military vehicles moving down the Dar-ul-Aman road at about 8 a.m. local time and exploded. [6] The blast created a deep crater in the road near the ruined Darul Aman Palace . [7] The bombing happened during the rush hour close to the National Assembly of Afghanistan . The blast destroyed 5 US military vehicles and 13 civilian vehicles. [8] Most of the dead were Afghan civilians including women and children in a public bus which was driving by when the explosion happened. [9] Five US soldiers were among the dead. The dead Canadian soldier was identified as Colonel Geoff Parker originally from Oakville, Ontario . He is the highest-ranked Canadian soldier killed in Afghanistan. [10] [2] An American colonel, 2 American lieutenant colonels and their 2 American drivers were also killed. [11] The American officers were identified as colonel John M. McHugh, 46, from New Jersey and lieutenant colonels, Paul R. Bartz, 43, of Waterloo, Wisconsin , and Thomas P. Belkofer, 44, of Perrysburg, Ohio . [4]
The Taliban took responsibility for the attack. [7] They stated that they had sent a man named Nizamuddin to carry out the attack. Several analysts believe that the attack reflected Taliban opposition to the upcoming peace jirga proposed by President Hamid Karzai . [12] According to Afghanistan's spy agency the attack was allegedly carried out by Pakistan' spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence . Saeed Ansari a spokesman for National Directorate of Security, Afghanistan’s spy agency stated that 'All the explosions and terrorist attacks by these people were plotted from the other side of the border and most of the explosives and materials used for the attacks were brought from the other side to Afghanistan.' [11] According to US military intelligence officials Haqqani network based in Pakistan was also involved in the attack. [13]
The attack drew strong condemnation from Anders Fogh Rasmussen , the Secretary General of NATO . [2] Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada in a statement condemned the attack and mourned Parker calling him a "great Canadian who will be greatly missed by the Canadian Forces family and his community." [14]

April 2010 U.S consulate and ANP attack - Wikipedia, the ... On April 5, 2010, two bombings in Pakistan killed up to 50 people and injured 100 more. In the first attack the U.S. Consulate in Peshawar was attacked by militants ... From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia
  (Redirected from 2010 Peshawar bombings )
Location
‡ indicates attacks resulting in more than 100 deaths
Underline indicates the deadliest terrorist attack/s to date
Contents
The American consulate attack killed 8 people including 2 security service personnel. [6] However, no Americans were hurt in the attack. The perpetrators were armed with guns and grenades and two car bombs. The security barrier was damaged, while shells from rocket-propelled grenades and hand grenades were seen in the vicinity. Police said one of the car bombs exploded at a checkpoint 50 metres from the consulate, while the other 100 kg bomb went off close to the consulate gate. At least three blasts were reported before a firefight between security forces and the attackers followed. According to Pakistan police official Ghulam Hussain, "The target was certainly the American consulate but they didn't succeed in getting there...one of the suicide bombers blew himself up close to the gate. Police guarding the US consulate started retaliatory fire. More blasts took place. We have recovered unexploded material from four different points". [5] The US Consulate General said two Pakistani security guards employed by the Consulate General were among those killed in the attack. [2]
Hours earlier 44 people died in a suicide attack at a rally in the north-western town of Timergara , Lower Dir District , during a meeting of the Awami National Party (ANP), the ruling coalition in North West Frontier Province . Zahid Khan, an Awami National Party spokesperson, said his party were celebrating plans to change the name of the North West Frontier Province when a suspected suicide bomber detonated his explosives. [8] An official of the ruling ANP party, Hashim Khan Babar, told the media the attacks appeared to be in response to a major security operation which was launched in the Orakzai tribal region near Peshawar last week. [7]
Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the attacks in a telephone release by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan spokesman Azam Tariq, with the statement “We accept the attacks on the American consulate. This is revenge for drone attacks. We have already told you that we have 2,800 to 3,000 fedayeen (suicide bombers). We will carry out more such attacks. We will target any place where there are Americans” [2] The attack was revenge for Drone attacks in Pakistan . [9]
A BBC analyst said the Pakistani Taliban were apparently aiming for a feat to match the one last December in Khost, Afghanistan , in which several American CIA officials were killed. [7]
An analyst in the capital said that after the government war on the Taliban the militants spread into more settled areas. He added that "The American consulate is one of the most well guarded places in Peshawar. It [the attack] was well planned and they very confidently hit their target." Al Jazeera's correspondent also noted that "Although they have been driven out of their strongholds in key areas, there is a feeling that a substantial number of those people have now infiltrated into the settled areas. There is trouble in the southern parts of the Punjab - so you do see some sort of regrouping attempt and a fear that there maybe an escalation of this sort of violence." [8]
The United States embassy in Pakistan released a statement condemning the attack and saying that it reflected the "terrorists' desperation". [10] Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesmen, added: "We strongly condemn the violence and the actions. And I would point out that ... extremists in Pakistan have succeeded in killing Pakistanis, which I think hardens the view that has led to gains that have been made over the course of the year against extremism by native Pakistanis." [8]

Attacks
The American consulate attack killed 8 people including 2 security service personnel. [6] However, no Americans were hurt in the attack. The perpetrators were armed with guns and grenades and two car bombs. The security barrier was damaged, while shells from rocket-propelled grenades and hand grenades were seen in the vicinity. Police said one of the car bombs exploded at a checkpoint 50 metres from the consulate, while the other 100 kg bomb went off close to the consulate gate. At least three blasts were reported before a firefight between security forces and the attackers followed. According to Pakistan police official Ghulam Hussain, "The target was certainly the American consulate but they didn't succeed in getting there...one of the suicide bombers blew himself up close to the gate. Police guarding the US consulate started retaliatory fire. More blasts took place. We have recovered unexploded material from four different points". [5] The US Consulate General said two Pakistani security guards employed by the Consulate General were among those killed in the attack. [2]
Hours earlier 44 people died in a suicide attack at a rally in the north-western town of Timergara , Lower Dir District , during a meeting of the Awami National Party (ANP), the ruling coalition in North West Frontier Province . Zahid Khan, an Awami National Party spokesperson, said his party were celebrating plans to change the name of the North West Frontier Province when a suspected suicide bomber detonated his explosives. [8] An official of the ruling ANP party, Hashim Khan Babar, told the media the attacks appeared to be in response to a major security operation which was launched in the Orakzai tribal region near Peshawar last week. [7]
Perpetrators
Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the attacks in a telephone release by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan spokesman Azam Tariq, with the statement “We accept the attacks on the American consulate. This is revenge for drone attacks. We have already told you that we have 2,800 to 3,000 fedayeen (suicide bombers). We will carry out more such attacks. We will target any place where there are Americans” [2] The attack was revenge for Drone attacks in Pakistan . [9]
A BBC analyst said the Pakistani Taliban were apparently aiming for a feat to match the one last December in Khost, Afghanistan , in which several American CIA officials were killed. [7]
Repercussions
An analyst in the capital said that after the government war on the Taliban the militants spread into more settled areas. He added that "The American consulate is one of the most well guarded places in Peshawar. It [the attack] was well planned and they very confidently hit their target." Al Jazeera's correspondent also noted that "Although they have been driven out of their strongholds in key areas, there is a feeling that a substantial number of those people have now infiltrated into the settled areas. There is trouble in the southern parts of the Punjab - so you do see some sort of regrouping attempt and a fear that there maybe an escalation of this sort of violence." [8]
Reactions
The United States embassy in Pakistan released a statement condemning the attack and saying that it reflected the "terrorists' desperation". [10] Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesmen, added: "We strongly condemn the violence and the actions. And I would point out that ... extremists in Pakistan have succeeded in killing Pakistanis, which I think hardens the view that has led to gains that have been made over the course of the year against extremism by native Pakistanis." [8]

Underline indicates the deadliest terrorist attack/s to date
Contents
Pakistan which has a mostly Sunni population has seen sectarian attacks against minorities including Shias who account for about 20% of Pakistan's population. It is estimated that 4000 people have been killed in religious violence over the last decade. [6] This was the third attack against Lahore's minority communities in 2010: in May two mosques were attacked belonging to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community , and in July the Sufi community came under attack . While the government of Pakistan has banned several militant groups many of them have re emerged under different names and critics say that governments reluctance to act against them is encouraging them. [7]
These were the first major attacks in Pakistan since the country was devastated by 2010 Pakistan floods . [6]
The blasts targeted a procession by about 35,000 Shia to mark the death anniversary of Ali whom they consider to be their first Imam . [3] The three blasts occurred within 2,000 feet (610 m) of each other. [8] The first explosion happened in the Karbala Gamay Shah area at 6:50 pm local time. This was followed by a second explosion about 25 minutes later in Bhati chowk . The third blast happened in Anarkali Bazaar about 10 minutes after the second explosion. [5] Bodies of three suicide bombers have been recovered according to government sources. [3]
Two days later the death toll rose to 38.
After the blasts angry mobs attacked police stations and burnt vehicles leading to deployment of Pakistan Rangers to maintain law and order. [5] After the attack the authorities urged people not to hold outdoor religious meetings. [7]
Three days of mourning was ordered by the provincial government and all private and public institutions were closed. [5] The attacks were condemned by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani who vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. [3] The Chief Minister of Punjab Shahbaz Sharif announced compensation of Rs 500,000 for those killed and Rs 75,000 for the injured. [10]
Following another attack in Quetta 2 days later, Interior Minister Rehman Malik told the press that militants want to fan the flames of sectarianism in an effort to destabilise the government followinga series of military offensives against them. He also claimed that Punjabi, such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, and al-Qaida and the Tehrik-e-Taliban are one and the same. [11]

Pakistan, which has a mostly Sunni population, has seen sectarian attacks against minorities including Shias, who account for about 35–40% of Pakistan's population, and are the followers of the Prophet's progeny. [3] Two days prior to these attacks dozens of Shias were killed in a similar attack in Lahore . Sunni militant groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan which operate freely in Pakistan have for years targeted minorities including Shias.
On the day prior to this attack Pakistan's interior minister Rehman Malik had asked the Shia community not to hold large gatherings due to security concerns. [6]
The procession was to mark the Quds Day event staged every year by the Shia community to oppose Israel's occupation of Jerusalem . [7] The rally drew an estimated 2,500 participants, mostly Shiias. The size of the blast caused a stampede. [3] The explosion occurred in the Meezan chowk area of the town. The bomb exploded around 3:05 pm local time. It was estimated that the suicide bomber used about 15 kilograms of explosives. [8]
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the attack and said a 22-year-old suicide bomber, Rashid Moaawia, carried out the attack. [8]
Following the blast, widespread protests erupted in the city with gunfire being heard across the city. Several shops were burnt by the protesters. [8] People were seen lying on the roads to avoid gunfire, while others set fire to vehicles and buildings to vent their anger. [7]
After the blast, police cordoned off the area and fired in the air to hold back people trying to search for their relatives. [3]
Thousands have attended a funeral in the Pakistani city of Quetta for victims of a suicide attack on a Shia Muslim procession.
The death toll from Friday's attack rose from 43 to 65 overnight as critically wounded people died in hospitals, police said on Saturday.
Shops and schools remained closed the following day. Security was also stepped up at mosques across Pakistan.
Thousands attended a funeral mass in Quetta. [9]
Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani condemned the attack and ordered an investigation. Interior Minister Rehman Malik told the press that militants want to fan the flames of sectarianism in an effort to destabilise the government following a series of military offensives against them. He also claimed that Punjabi, such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, and al-Qaida and the Tehrik-e-Taliban are one and the same. [10] Shiite Conference, Balochistan announced a 40-day mourning period in line with Shia custom. [3]
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon 's spokesman said "These attacks, which deliberately targeted Shiite Muslims and killed or injured scores of civilians, are unacceptable." [11]
Condemning the attacks the White House stated "To target innocent civilians during the Muslim holy month of Ramadan at an already difficult time as the country is working hard to recover from terrible flooding caused by monsoons makes these acts even more reprehensible." [12]

Geo News Video Blast in Lahore - Youm Ali Procession
The death toll from a triple bombing at a Shia Muslim gathering in eastern Pakistani city of Lahore has risen to 37 after many passed away in various hospitals.
Earlier reports said at least 28 people were killed after three bombs went off in quick succession during a crowded mourning procession in the Karbala Gamay Shah district of Lahore on Wednesday.
Medics said on Thursday that at least nine people succumbed to their injuries overnight at hospitals across the city, a Press TV correspondent reported.
Nearly 300 have wounded as attacks sent shock waves through the district.
The attacks came as Shia Muslims were marking the martyrdom of the first Shia Imam, Ali Ibn-Abi Taleb (PBUH).
President Asif Ali Zardari has condemned the bombings as a cowardly act of terrorism.
The death toll is expected to rise as some of the injured are said to be in critical condition.
Lahore has seen several bomb attacks over the past couple of years.
Pro-Taliban groups have launched a violent campaign against Shia Muslims, and they are stretching the terror campaign toward the so-called stable areas of Pakistan as well.
Several Shia religious gatherings have been targeted in the central province of Punjab over the past few months.

Death of two journalists[ edit ]
Two journalists Asfandyar Abid Naveed (ca. 1976 – 11 June 2011), also reported as Asfandyar Khan, a career journalist working for Akhbar-e-Khyber, [6] [7] and Shafiullah Khan (ca. 1983 – 17 June 2011), of The News , were killed as a result of covering the double suicide bombing in Peshawar. [8] [9] [10] [11] Naveed died at the scene from the second blast. His death in the attack prompted calls among Pakistan's professional journalism organisations for more attention to be placed on the safety of journalists and for more action by police. [7] [11]
Shafiullah Khan was a trainee reporter for the daily The News (Pakistan). [12] [9] He was from Palangzai village, North Waziristan . Khan had recently completed a Master's degree in journalism from Gomal University in Dera Ismail Khan . He had been working as a trainee for one week in Peshawar bureau of The News before the deadly bombings, according to the Khyber Union of Journalists, an affiliate of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ). Khan received third degree burns after the second blast was set off after military and media arrived. Khan was transferred to the Khyber Teaching Hospital's (KTH) burn unit. Doctors said he also received metal shrapnel in his right shoulder. A week later, 17 June 2011, Khan died in the burn treatment center in Wah Cantonment , a military center east of Islamabad . [9]
Just one month before this bombing, journalist Nasrullah Khan Afridi , of the Khyber News Agency, PTV News , Daily Mashriq , had been killed 10 May 2011, in the same Khyber Super Market as the other two journalists. [13] [14]
While the Taliban were suspected to have carried out the attack, the Pakistani Taliban spokesperson Ehsanullah Ehsan denied responsibility and blamed the attack on "foreign agents." "We did not carry out this attack in Peshawar. It is an attempt by foreign secret agencies who are doing it to malign us. We do not target innocent people. Our targets are very clear, we attack security forces, government and people who are siding with it." [5] In Pakistan, references made to 'foreign agencies' are well-circulated conspiracy theories and rumours that point to alleged CIA activities in Pakistan and the perception that covert American agents are carrying out an orchestrated campaign of terrorism in the country to destabilise it.[ citation needed ][ dubious – discuss ]
The Committee to Protect Journalists believe the attacks were politically motivated. The organisation listed both journalists' deaths as a result of a dangerous assignment. [7] [11] [15] [16]

PESHAWAR:  Taliban on Sunday denied responsibility for twin bomb blasts that ripped through a crowded market in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing 39 people and injuring dozens.
The attack, one of the deadliest in a series to hit Pakistan since US Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in May, devastated the Khyber Super Market district which includes a hotel, shops and student accommodation.
The Taliban, who have vowed to carry out attacks to avenge the killing of bin Laden, denied any role in the bombing and said they target only the government and military.
“We did not carry out this attack in Peshawar. It is an attempt by foreign secret agencies who are doing it to malign us,” Tehreek-e-Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan told AFP on phone.
“We do not target innocent people. Our targets are very clear, we attack security forces, government and people who are siding with it,” Ehsan said.

Midnight terror: At least 34 killed in Peshawar Cantt blasts
At least 34 people were killed and over 90 injured, among them television journalists and a senior police officer, when two blasts ripped through a marketplace in the garrison area of Peshawar just before midnight on Saturday.
“First a gas cylinder exploded at Lala Restaurant in Khyber Supermarket in Peshawar Cantt,” a witness told The Express Tribune. “People flocked to the site out of curiosity,” he added. “Minutes later, a huge blast rocked the market.”
SSP Operations Ejaz Khan corroborated the eyewitness’ account, saying it was a trap. “The cylinder was exploded to attract people to the site,” he added.
Khan said that the bomb was strapped to a motorcycle parked outside the ill-fated restaurant – a famous eatery of the city which is usually frequented by a large number of food-lovers. He said the explosive device weighed around 10 kilogrammes.
Capital City Police Officer Liaquat Ali Khan confirmed that at least 34 people were killed and over 90 wounded in the bombing. The casualties were ferried to different hospitals of the city, where a state of emergency was declared.
Medics at the Lady Reading Hospital told The Express Tribune that they have received 12 bodies and over 40 injured people – some of them in critical condition. The injured also include television journalists – among them Dunya TV Bureau chief Safiullah Gul – and SP Cantt Shafiullah Khan. However, doctors said their wounds are not life threatening.
Witnesses said that the restaurant and several adjoining shops were badly damaged in the explosion which also triggered a huge fire in the market. The explosion also caused a power outage in the area, and security and rescue officials were forced to work in the dark.
Khyber Supermarket is located in a high-security zone of Peshawar’s cantonment area.
The office of Khyber Agency’s political agent and a Pakistan Army residential colony are situated nearby.
The explosion took place exactly where a tribal journalist, Nasrullah Afridi, was killed in a targeted bomb blast last month.
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Information Minister Mian Iftikhar Hussain condemned the ‘cowardly terrorist attack’. Speaking to the media outside the LRH, he feared that the death toll could rise further.
Taliban militants have carried out a string of bombings and brazen gun attacks on civil and military targets to avenge the killing of al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.
Iftikhar Hussain called for bridging the trust deficit between all regional and international players to defeat terrorism.
The KP-K information minister added: “Pakistan, Afghanistan and the US-led coalition forces must abandon hypocritical policies if they want to defeat militancy.”

2 explosions kill 24 people in Pakistan

Reporting from Peshawar and Islamabad, Pakistan — A powerful suicide bomb ripped through a packed bakery in the Pakistani military town of Nowshera late Sunday, killing at least 18 people. The attack came just hours after an explosion in nearby Peshawar left six dead.
Scores of people were injured in the two bombings, officials and hospital staff said.
Turk Ali Shah, a police department spokesman in Nowshera, about 25 miles east of Peshawar, said many of the bodies were burned beyond recognition, complicating identification.
Army officers were among the dead, said local officials who requested anonymity, adding that the property belonged to the military.
The attacks came two days after Al Qaeda-linked militant leader Ilyas Kashmiri reportedly was killed by a U.S. drone attack in the Pakistani village of Ghwa Khwa. His followers had vowed retribution attacks, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility in either of Sunday's bombings.
Militants have stepped up attacks on Pakistani military targets lately, including last month's assault on the Mehran naval base in the southern port city of Karachi that left at least 10 security personnel dead.
Police official Fazal Maula told the Associated Press that the attacker in Nowshera was a young man who carried around 4 pounds of explosives.
Sohail Khan, a witness, said he saw charred bodies in the hospital, adding that a huge fire triggered by the blast had reduced the bakery and adjacent restaurant to ashes. "There was total chaos in the town, and the area is now without electricity," he said.
Earlier in the day, a bomb planted in a pickup truck exploded on the outskirts of Peshawar, killing six people. Police said the attacker parked the truck at a bazaar, and the explosion apparently was triggered by a timer.

Reporting from Peshawar and Islamabad, Pakistan — A powerful suicide bomb ripped through a packed bakery in the Pakistani military town of Nowshera late Sunday, killing at least 18 people. The attack came just hours after an explosion in nearby Peshawar left six dead.
Scores of people were injured in the two bombings, officials and hospital staff said.
Turk Ali Shah, a police department spokesman in Nowshera, about 25 miles east of Peshawar, said many of the bodies were burned beyond recognition, complicating identification.
Army officers were among the dead, said local officials who requested anonymity, adding that the property belonged to the military.
The attacks came two days after Al Qaeda-linked militant leader Ilyas Kashmiri reportedly was killed by a U.S. drone attack in the Pakistani village of Ghwa Khwa. His followers had vowed retribution attacks, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility in either of Sunday's bombings.

<h1>2005 Bali bombings - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The 2005 Bali bombings were a series of terrorist suicide bomb and a series of car bombs and attacks that occurred on 1 October 2005, in Bali, Indonesia. </h1>
(October 2013)
Location
Main square in central Kuta , warungs along the Jimbaran beach
Attack type
Contents
The Indonesian national news agency, ANTARA , reported that the first two explosions occurred at 6:50 p.m. local time, near a Jimbaran food court and the third at 7:00 pm. in Kuta Town Square. Other reports claim that the blasts occurred at around 7:15 p.m. At least 3 blasts were reported.
One of the blasts struck Raja's Restaurant at the Kuta Square shopping mall in central Kuta . Another two bombs exploded at warungs along the Jimbaran beach, one of which was near the Four Seasons Hotel . These areas are generally popular with Western tourists. [1] Police later said they had found three unexploded bombs in Jimbaran. They had apparently failed to go off after the security forces hastily shut down the island’s mobile telephone network following the first blasts. [2]
According to Indonesia's head of counter-terrorism, Major General Ansyaad Mbai, early evidence indicates that the attacks were carried out by at least three suicide bombers in a similar fashion to the 2002 bombings. The remnants of backpacks and excessively mutilated bodies are believed to be evidence of suicide bombings. There remains also a possibility that backpacks were hidden inside the target restaurants before detonation. [3] [4] [5] Australian Federal Police Commissioner Mick Keelty said that the bombs used appear to have differed from previous blasts in that most deaths and injuries had been inflicted by shrapnel , rather than chemical explosion. A medical officer's x-rays showed foreign objects described as "pellets" in many victims' bodies and a victim reported ball bearings lodged in her back. [6]
The bombings occurred the same day that Indonesia cut its fuel subsidies resulting in gas prices rising by 675% and just two days before the start of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan and 11 days before the third anniversary of the 2002 Bali bombing . The attack came during the school holiday period in some states of Australia , when an estimated 7,500 Australians are believed to have been visiting Bali.
* Excludes the 3 suicide bombers
The latest report cites 20 dead and between 101 to 129 injured. [7] Some earlier reports put the number of fatalities at between 26 to 36 people, but those figures have since been lowered. Among those killed are 15 Indonesians, 4 Australians, and a Japanese national, not counting the 3 suicide bombers. The wounded included many Indonesians, mostly Hindus while the rest were 45 Australians, 6 South Koreans, 6 Americans, 4 Japanese, 3 Canadians and 1 Briton. As there were no records at the hospitals or morgues on the locations from where the victims arrived, it is not possible to determine the casualty figures at each blast location separately.[ citation needed ]
Most of the casualties were sent to Bali's Sanglah General Hospital , and mostly treated for injuries caused by broken glass. [17] Others were sent to Griya Asih Hospital. [18] As in the 2002 bombings, some of the injured, primarily foreign nationals, were evacuated to medical facilities in Australia and Singapore . [19] [20] The less seriously injured were evacuated to Singapore, while other casualties, among them Australians, Japanese and an Indonesian, were evacuated to treatment in Darwin, Australia aboard a Royal Australian Air Force C-130 Hercules .
Following the 2002 Bali bombings , in which more Australians than any other nationals were killed and injured, and the 2004 bombing of Australia's Embassy in Jakarta , the latest attacks received extensive coverage in Australia and were denounced by some officials, such as Federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley , as an attack on Australians. [21]
Indonesian authorities were expecting such an event, after the Indonesian president warned of more bombings within the country, and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs (DFAT) had issued warnings two days before the event. However, the Australian government claimed that it received no specific prior warning of a terrorist attack being imminent in Bali. Minister Downer also played down any knowledge of specific signs of the potential event, despite the DFAT warning on the last day of September. [22] DFAT warned Australians against non-essential travel to Indonesia since before the 2002 attacks – a warning still in effect. The department advises travellers against congregating in areas popular with Western tourists.
In May 2005, the US State Department issued a travel warning against non-essential trips to Indonesia. The travel warning was last updated January 9, 2007. [23]
A Philippine security official said that for months intelligence officials in Southeast Asia had received information that the al-Qaeda-linked Jemaah Islamiyah group was orchestrating a major strike, possibly in the Philippines or Indonesia, but were unable to uncover the plot's details in time to prevent it. [24]
The Australian Broadcasting Corporation 's National News Radio network reported on October 3 that several Australian tourists had heard rumours about a planned bombing, prompting federal Opposition Leader Kim Beazley to urge the Australian government to form closer intelligence ties with Indonesia.
On August 31, 2005, one month before the second Bali bombing, terrorists managed to put a partially assembled bomb on the 4th floor of Kuta Paradiso hotel. The bomb passed the security check at the hotel and the security cameras on the hotel were broken. There were no explosives in the bomb.[ citation needed ]
The attacks bear the hallmarks of the active terrorist network Jemaah Islamiah (JI), which is believed to be responsible for several bombings in Indonesia, including the 2002 Bali nightclub bombing , the 2003 Marriott Hotel bombing and the 2004 Australian Embassy bombing . Rohan Gunaratna , head of terrorism research at Singapore's Institute of Defence and Strategic Studies , told Agence France-Presse that "The only group that has the intention and capability to mount a coordinated and simultaneous attack against a western target in Indonesia is Jemaah Islamiyah ." [25]
Although a link to JI has not been confirmed, the bombings were quickly condemned as terrorist attacks by the authorities. Police Major General Ansyaad Mbai, a top Indonesian anti-terrorism official, told the Associated Press that the bombings "were clearly the work of terrorists". [26] Major General Mbai identified Malaysian men, already wanted in connection to previous bombings in Indonesia, as the suspected masterminds of the attacks. The chief suspect was Azahari Husin , a member of JI who was an engineering expert and former academic with a doctorate from University of Reading (late 1980s). Husin was nicknamed the "Demolition Man" and was thought to have collaborated with the second suspect: Noordin Mohammed Top , a bomb maker whose wife was sentenced to three years in prison for harbouring him. [27] Azahari was killed in a police raid in November 2005, while Noordin "has been killed after a lengthy and violent siege, Indonesia's police chief said" by "heavily armed counter-terrorism police" on 16 September 2009. [28]
Motivations for the bombings remain unclear. Some, such as the Australian Prime Minister, have suggested the attacks were intended to undermine Indonesia's moderate democratic government. Moreover, media organisations have suggested that the attack was planned to correspond with massive fuel price increases in Indonesia, so as to maximise economic and political damage. On the contrary, Dr Sidney Jones, of the International Crisis Group , believes that it was not an attempt to undermine democracy "per se", but rather an example of jihadist extremism: "I think they very much see the world in a black and white way, us against them, Muslims against infidels... [They see] that the infidels led by the United States as part of a Christian-Zionist conspiracy are out to persecute and attack and eliminate Muslims around the world, and therefore, [they] have to run away." However, in common with the Prime Minister, Dr Jones believes the attack was indiscriminate and not an attack on Australians "per se". She suggested Bali was selected as the site of the attacks because there was less chance of Indonesian gangsters being killed, and there was "a chance of getting a few foreigners". [29]
Following the attacks Abu Bakar Bashir , who is alleged to be JI's spiritual leader, released a statement from his prison cell, condemning the attack. But he added that the bombings were a sign of God's displeasure with the Indonesian government. He said: "I suggest the government bring themselves closer to God by implementing his rules and laws because these happenings are warnings from God for all of us." [30] In an interview with Scott Atran from his cell in Cipinang Prison, Jakarta, Bashir said: "I call those who carried out these actions all mujahid. They all had a good intention, that is, Jihad in Allah’s way, the aim of the jihad is to look for blessing from Allah. They are right that America is the proper target because America fights Islam. So in terms of their objectives, they are right, and the target of their attacks was right also. [31]
Indonesian police believed that three suicide bombers carried out the bombings. A presidential spokesman Dino Djalal said that the police found a total of "six legs and three heads but no middle bodies, and that's the strong sign of suicide bombers." Photos of the three heads were published in The Jakarta Post on Monday, October 3, 2005. [32] Initially, there were conflicting reports on the number of bombs; but later, the police confirmed only three bombs. [33]
An amateur video capturing the scene at the restaurant in Kuta showed one bomber with a backpack walking inside just seconds before a huge explosion. [9]
On the following Monday, on October 3, 2005, the police issued an appeal to the public for help identifying the suspected suicide bombers whose dismembered remains were found at the scene. Photos of the dead suspects were later distributed widely and a hotline was set up to receive tips.
According to Banten Police Chief Senior Commissioner Badrodin Haiti, the Indonesian police are seeking five members of a ring led by Imam Samudra , who has been sentenced to death for his role in the 2002 Bali bombings . Three of the five men had already served jail sentences for holding explosives belonging to Samudra. They were under police surveillance but had disappeared from their homes. [30]
On October 9, 2005, police in Bali arrested a man, identified by the initials HS, who is allegedly a former roommate of one of the suicide bomber. [34]
According to Indonesian police, in 2005, a corrupt prison warden at the Kerobokan prison smuggled a laptop inside for Imam Samudra, the leader of the terrorist group involved in the first Bali bombing. He then used the laptop and a wireless connection to chat with other terrorist suspects.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono condemned the blasts as a "criminal act" and has called for an urgent meeting with Indonesian security officials. He visited the island. He vowed that those responsible would be caught, saying "We will hunt down the perpetrators and bring them to justice." [5] [35]
Coordinating Minister for Political, Legal and Security Affairs Widodo AS. , State Intelligence Agency Head Syamsir Siregar and Police Chief General Sutanto have been instructed by the Indonesian President to leave for Bali on the evening of 1 October 2005. [35]
Vice-President Jusuf Kalla told the BBC that the government is uncertain of the group responsible for these attacks.

<h1>Indonesia on high alert after president warns of more </h1>
03.10.2005 | Source:
 
Indonesia's capital was on top alert after the president warned of more attacks following three suicide bombings on Bali Island on Monday, where a chilling video shot by a tourist showed a suspected bomber clutching a backpack as he strolled past diners moments before one of the blasts.
The near-simultaneous bombings , which killed 26 and injured 100 on Saturday, appeared to have been planned by Southeast Asia's two most-wanted men, Indonesian anti-terror official Maj. Gen. Ansyaad Mbai said Sunday.
But the alleged masterminds Azahari bin Husin and Noordin Mohamed Top, both Malaysian were not among the suspected bombers, whose decapitated remains were found at the scenes, officials said. All three were believed to be fitted with explosive belts, police said.
The attack came three years after 202 people were killed in nightclub bombings on Bali, Indonesia's premier resort island.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono warned that terrorists could be planning more strikes in the world's most populous Muslim nation as Jakarta's police chief elevated the capital's security status to top alert, putting two-thirds of its police force on stand by.
"The terrorists are still looking for soft targets," Yudhoyono said at a news conference Sunday after getting a firsthand look at the devastation.
Last month, Yudhoyono said that the extremist network might strike Jakarta during September or October. He said over the weekend that his warning was based on intelligence that the terrorists had already prepared the explosives.
Nobody claimed responsibility for Saturday night's coordinated attacks on two packed seafood cafes in the Jimbaran beach resort and the Raja Cafe in the bustling tourist center of Kuta, where bombers struck nightclubs in 2002.

<h1>Australian travellers warned of high terrorist threat in </h1>
Mashable
Australians are being warned of the high possibility of a terror attack in Indonesia, with the government lifting its travel warning for the region.
The alert, posted to the government website smarttraveller.com.au , advises Aussie travellers to be alert when travelling in Indonesia. Bali and other areas in Indonesia are popular with Australian tourists during holiday periods.
"We advise you to exercise a high degree of caution in Indonesia, including Bali, at this time due to the high threat of terrorist attack," the alert said. "We continue to receive information that indicates that terrorists may be planning attacks in Indonesia, which could take place at any time."
Foreign Minister Julie Bishop told a press conference Tuesday that Australians should take note of the latest warning and ensure they have travel insurance. "There is always the need to be alert when travelling overseas," she said. "We are currently working with Indonesia law enforcement agencies."
The recent warning followed an alert by the U.S. on Jan. 3 regarding a potential threat in Surabaya, Indonesia's second largest city and the departure city of AirAsia flight 8501 . The U.S. did not associate the plane crash with the latest terror alert.
“The U.S. Embassy has been made aware of a potential threat against U.S.-associated hotels and banks in Surabaya, Indonesia. The U.S. Embassy recommends heightened vigilance and awareness of one’s surroundings when visiting such facilities,” the U.S. Embassy in Jakarta posted on its website.
Police in Jakarta have refuted the claims, telling The Jakarta Post there is no risk of a terror attack in the region.
“There’s nothing to worry about since the intelligence assessment carried out by the National Police’s head of intelligence and security department has so far found that there are no public order disruptions [in Surabaya] related to any terror plot,” National Police spokesman Inspector General Ronny F. Sompie was quoted by the newspaper as saying.
Tourists have been targeted in multiple deadly terror attacks in Bali, including the 2002 bombing in the nightclub area in Kuta, which killed 202 people. Another major attack happened in 2005, when a series of bombs were detonated in Jimbaran Bay and Kuta, killing 20 people.
In October, a former key Jemaah Islamiyah militant-turned police collaborator, Nasir Abas, warned the Islamic State is planning an attack on the region as revenge for the U.S.-led airstrikes, according to News Limited.

2009 Jakarta Bombings - World News JW Marriott Jakarta Bombing July 2009 Captured by CCTV, Jakarta Bombings 2009, Jakarta Bomb in The Ritz Carlton Hotel in Indonesia July 17, 2009 CCTV, Jakarta ... Email the Collage
At around 7:50 am local time (0:50 UTC) on 17 July 2009, the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Hotels in Jakarta , Indonesia , were hit by separate bombings five minutes apart. Three of the seven victims who were killed were Australians , two from The Netherlands , and one each from New Zealand and Indonesia. More than 50 people were injured in the blasts. Both blasts were caused by suicide bombers, who checked into the hotels as paying guests several days earlier. The twin suicide bombings came four years after the last serious terrorist attack in Indonesia.
Since the 2002 Bali bombings , in which over 200 were killed, Indonesia has stepped up attempts to crack down on terrorism. An anti-terrorism law was confirmed by the Indonesian legislature in 2003. The 2002 attack was carried out by Jemaah Islamiyah , an al-Qaeda -linked group seeking to unite Indonesia, Malaysia , and the southern Philippines under an Islamic state.
The Marriott bombing occurred first and was followed five minutes later by the Ritz bombing. Police moved to seal off the surrounding area. At noon local time, an unexploded bomb was found in room 1808 of the Marriott, together with "bomb-making equipment".

<h1>2009 Jakarta Bombings - World News JW Marriott Jakarta Bombing July 2009 Captured by CCTV, Jakarta Bombings 2009, Jakarta Bomb in The Ritz Carlton Hotel in Indonesia July 17, 2009 CCTV, Jakarta </h1>
Email the Collage
At around 7:50 am local time (0:50 UTC) on 17 July 2009, the JW Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Hotels in Jakarta , Indonesia , were hit by separate bombings five minutes apart. Three of the seven victims who were killed were Australians , two from The Netherlands , and one each from New Zealand and Indonesia. More than 50 people were injured in the blasts. Both blasts were caused by suicide bombers, who checked into the hotels as paying guests several days earlier. The twin suicide bombings came four years after the last serious terrorist attack in Indonesia.
Since the 2002 Bali bombings , in which over 200 were killed, Indonesia has stepped up attempts to crack down on terrorism. An anti-terrorism law was confirmed by the Indonesian legislature in 2003. The 2002 attack was carried out by Jemaah Islamiyah , an al-Qaeda -linked group seeking to unite Indonesia, Malaysia , and the southern Philippines under an Islamic state.
The Marriott bombing occurred first and was followed five minutes later by the Ritz bombing. Police moved to seal off the surrounding area. At noon local time, an unexploded bomb was found in room 1808 of the Marriott, together with "bomb-making equipment".

<h1>2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks - Wikipedia, the </h1>
Site of the attacks
Deaths
6 Israeli civilians, 1 Israeli soldier, 1 Israeli Yamam policeman, 5 Egyptian soldiers, 10 attackers [2]
Non-fatal injuries
Perpetrators
Presumably 12 assailants. Israel has stated that the attacks were orchestrated by the Gaza based Popular Resistance Committees , who deny involvement. [4] Egyptian sources report that three of the attackers were Sinai-based Egyptians. [2] [5]
On August 18, 2011, a series of cross-border attacks with parallel attacks and mutual cover was carried out in southern Israel on Highway 12 near the Egyptian border by a squad of presumably 12 militants in four groups. [2] The attacks occurred after Israel's interior security service Shin Bet had warned of an attack by militants in the region and Israeli troops had been stationed in the area. [6] The militants first opened fire at an Egged No. 392 bus as it was traveling on Highway 12 in the Negev near Eilat . [3] [7] Several minutes later, a bomb was detonated next to an Israeli army patrol along Israel's border with Egypt. In a third attack, an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians. [8] Eight Israelis – six civilians, one Yamam special unit police sniper and one Golani Brigade soldier—were killed in the multiple-stage attack. [9] [10] The Israel Defense Forces reported eight attackers killed, and Egyptian security forces reported killing another two. [2]
Five Egyptian soldiers were also killed. According to Egypt, they were killed by Israeli security forces chasing militants across the Egyptian border, while an Israeli military officer initially said they were killed by a suicide bomber who had fled across the border into Egypt. [11] The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between Egypt and Israel and led to mass protests outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo. According to media reports, Egypt threatened to withdraw its ambassador to Israel, but Egypt's foreign minister later denied this. [2] Israel expressed regret over the deaths, and sent a letter of apology to Egypt. [12] The IDF was ordered to conduct a military probe of the incident, [13] [14] and on August 25, 2011, Israel agreed to a joint investigation with Egypt of the events. [15]
The identity of the attackers, three of whom were reportedly Egyptian, [16] is not widely agreed upon, [17] and so far no group took responsibility for the attacks. The Israeli government accused the Palestinian Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), a Gaza -based coalition of Palestinian militant groups, of orchestrating the attacks, [18] but the PRC denies involvement. [19] However, Israel attacked seven targets in the Gaza Strip immediately after the terror attacks in the Negev, killing five members of the PRC, including its leader. [20]
On August 21, 2011, an informal ceasefire was called by Israel and Hamas after days of escalating violence in which fifteen Palestinians were killed and many were wounded. More than 100 rockets and mortar shells were fired from Gaza into Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding more than a dozen. [21] The ceasefire was broken almost immediately by rocket fire from Gaza on southern Israel, followed by retaliatory Israeli airstrikes, killing at least seven Palestinians, among them two leaders of the Islamic Jihad . On August 26, 2011, Gaza militants called a second truce. [22] On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , Zuhir al-Qaisi , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks. [23]

The southern part of Israeli Highway 12 runs adjacent to Israel's border with Egypt. It was the scene of previous shooting attacks in the 1990s.[ citation needed ] In the late 2000s, the Israeli government decided to build the Israel–Egypt barrier , although by 2011 only 10% of it had been completed, none close to the site of the attack. [24]
Following the 2011 Egyptian revolution militant organizations increased their activity in the Sinai Peninsula and Al-Qaeda militants groups were established, [25] after Egyptian police had all but completely withdrawn from the northern Sinai, dominated by Bedouin tribes. During the months preceding the cross-border attacks, Egypt reinforced its forces with about 1,000 additional soldiers in the Sinai Peninsula, with the consent of Israel, after a series of five bombings had disrupted the flow of natural gas to Israel. [26]
On July 30, militants staged an attack on an Egyptian police station in El-Arish, killing six. [27]
On August 2, a group claiming to be the Sinai wing of Al Qaeda declared its intention to create an Islamic caliphate in the Sinai. [28]
On August 14, 2011, Egyptian forces swept the Sinai Peninsula in search of terror cells. [29] Jordanian intelligence informed the Israelis that they had information about an impending terror attack in the south of Israel. [30] Two days prior to the attack, the Egyptian army captured four Islamist insurgents as they prepared to blow up a gas pipeline in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula. [31]
Israeli interior security service Shin Bet had warned of terrorist attacks being planned in the region in an area 80 kilometers long, presuming that they would take place at night. The warnings led to a massive deployment of IDF troops, [6] and the closing of Highway 12, which was reopened only on the day of the attack at the order of head of IDF's southern command Tal Russo . [32]
August 18 cross-border attacks and immediate Israeli response[ edit ]
The original attacks occurred in three coordinated stages. [8] They were carried out by 12 militants in four groups dispersed over an area 12 kilometers long. At least some of the attackers wore brown uniforms, similar to those used by the Egyptian Army . [2] Israeli military and police forces, in cooperation with Shin Bet , began pursuing the perpetrators immediately after the attacks commenced and locked down the area. [33]
The attacks commenced around 12:00 pm (UTC+2) near the Ein Netafim spring, on Highway 12 from Mitzpe Ramon to Eilat , when three militants spread out about 200 meters from one another, [10] armed with suicide bomb vests, grenades , RPGs , and machine guns opened fire on an Egged passenger bus on line 392, carrying mostly soldiers but also some civilians. [8] Seven passengers were wounded, most of them soldiers. [34] According to eyewitnesses, a white car was following the bus, and a group of people dressed in military uniforms got out and opened fire. The bus driver, Benny Belevsky, did not stop the bus and sped away, getting to an IDF post near the Netafim Border Crossing . [35]
The militants, dressed in brown uniforms resembling those of the Egyptian Army, then began attacking passing vehicles, waving white handkerchiefs to fool motorists. [2] One of the militants attacked a bus that drove by and detonated the suicide bomb belt he was wearing, killing himself and the bus driver, who had stopped the empty bus. [34] Another militant opened fire at a passing car and killed the female driver. The same militant then fired an RPG at an Israeli Air Force helicopter, but missed. An IDF jeep from the Golani Brigade then arrived at the scene and ran over the militant, killing him. [10] Another Golani Brigade jeep arrived, and ran over a roadside bomb. As the soldiers exited the damaged vehicle, the surviving militant opened fire at them. Soldiers and Yamam special police officers then located the militant and killed him in a gunbattle. Two other militants then opened fire at the from Egyptian territory. Israeli forces briefly crossed the border and killed both of the militants. One Israeli soldier was killed by friendly fire during the engagement and several soldiers were wounded. [36] [37] [38] [39] The Egyptian Army informed the IDF that its soldiers killed two more militants in the Sinai. [10]
In the third attack, which occurred around 12:35, mortar shells were fired at soldiers carrying out routine maintenance work at the security fence constructed along the border between Israel and Egypt. No one was hurt in the attack. [33] [40]
Around 13:30, not far from the first shooting incident, militants opened fire, including with an anti-tank missile , at a bus and private car on route 90, a desert road near the border with Jordan . According to medics, five people were killed in the attacks. [7] Seven people were wounded when another private vehicle was hit by an anti-tank missile. Eyewitnesses suggested that some of the attackers may have been wearing Egyptian Army uniforms. [41] Two IAF helicopters were called to the scene in order to evacuate those wounded.
IDF medic Anastasia Bagdalov was awarded military commendation for her response to the attack. She was a passenger on the bus that was attacked by militants. Begdlov used her bra as a tourniquet on a severely wounded passenger's artery.
Around 18:30, an Israeli patrol was fired on from the Egyptian border as it searched for militants. Israeli troops returned fire, and the shooting lasted for about an hour. A sniper from the Yamam special police unit was critically wounded and later died. News of the firefight interrupted a briefing by the Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Chief of Staff Benny Gantz . [42] [43] [44]
According to an Egyptian probe, Israeli troops entered the Sinai Peninsula chasing after the terrorists, exchanging fire with Egyptian police, and an Israeli helicopter fired two rockets at the terrorists and machine guns at Egyptian security personnel, killing an Egyptian officer and two policemen. [2] In a later incident, first reported as a suicide bomb attack, [45] another two Egyptian soldiers were killed, presumably also by Israeli forces. [2] Some Israeli sources claimed that an IDF investigation said that the IDF's attack helicopters avoided hitting the Egyptian military and that it remains unclear who fired the deadly shots. [46]
The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries and lead to mass protests in Cairo outside the Israeli embassy. [47]
Following the attack, all roads to and from Eilat were sealed off and operations at Ovda Airport were suspended. Roadblocks were set up at the entrance to the city of Eilat, and the area was locked down. Magen David Adom (Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service) raised its alert level and began preparing teams of paramedics and medical equipment. The Israeli Air Force sent in Eilat police deployed a large number of security forces and a police war room was opened at the Yoseftal Medical Center . Seven of the 29 injured people who were brought to the Yoseftal Medical Center were later transferred to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba . [30] The police asked the public to expect roadblocks at the entrance to Eilat amidst a heavy police presence in the city; however later in the day they added that no security incidents were under way in either Eilat or Beersheba despite calling for public vigilance and for the public-at-large to contact police in case of any suspicious individuals or items.

According to SITE a group calling itself Ansar Jerusalem claimed responsibility for the attack. [61] Nevertheless, Israel stated that it possesses evidence that indicate that the attacks were orchestrated by the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) in Gaza. [7] [62]
The (PRC) denied any involvement in the attack, though they praised it. According to PRC spokesman, "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems ". [63] According to Haaretz, there is doubt in Gaza, that members of the Popular Resistance Committees were behind the attack. The Egyptian daily Al-Masry Al-Youm reported that Egyptian security forces identified three of those responsible for the attack as Egyptians. [64]
Hamas, which governs Gaza, also denied involvement. [65] Sky News quoted Hamas spokesman Taher al-Nunu as saying: "The Palestinian government denies the accusations made by Barak about the operation in Eilat and affirms that there is no relation between the Gaza Strip and what happened near Eilat." [66] Hamas did, however, "praise" the attack. [67]
The Washington Times reported that US intelligence agencies linked Al Qaeda to the attack, claiming that either the PRC or the Gaza-based Jaish al Islam carried out the attacks. [68]
August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids
Casualties and losses None 14 Palestinians killed including at least 6 senior PRC militants; "scores" injured [69] [70]
At 18.00 the Israeli Air Force , [71] working with Shin Bet , [7] bombed a building used by Popular Resistance Committees' members in Rafah . Five PRC members were killed. Among the dead was the PRC's commander Kamal al-Nairab and military chief Immad Hammad, [72] [73] [74] who was suspected by Shin Bet of having planned the attacks. Of the remaining three, two were top members. [7] The two-year-old son of one of the militants, who was in the building when it was attacked, was also killed. [72] The airstrike occurred in the southern Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border. [75] [76] The PRC responded to the attack in saying that it vows "double" revenge. [7] Later, the Israeli Air Force launched a wave of attacks against targets in Gaza. A home near the former Palestinian intelligence headquarters was hit, reportedly killing one and wounding seventeen, and starting a large fire in the area. Israeli aircraft fired three missiles at a building used by Hamas security forces, and bombed a Hamas outpost in Khan Yunis . A missile was also fired at an open area in the southern Gaza Strip. Several targets were bombed in the northern Gaza Strip, including a building used by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades . Several targets were hit around the Philadelphi Route , believed to have been smuggling tunnels. [77] Numerous rocket-launching cells were attacked during the airstrikes. Three Palestinian militants were killed as they participated in the firing of rockets, and senior PRC member Samed Abdul Mu'ty Abed was killed while riding a motorcycle in northern Gaza. Another man was injured in the attack that killed Abed. [21] [78] [79]
The Israeli Air Force bombed two tunnels and one warehouse used for manufacturing weapons in southern Gaza and one site used for militant activities. The tunnels had been used to allow assailants to infiltrate Israel and carry out attacks according to a statement released by the IDF Spokesperson's Unit . The IAF identified direct hits, and all aircraft returned to Israel safely. [80] An airstrike in central Gaza targeting a car killed a Palestinian militant, his five-year-old son, and his brother. [73] [81]
On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed Zuhir al-Qaisi , the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks, and his collaborator, Mahmoud Hanani. [23]
Palestinian militant response to Israeli air strikes[ edit ]
After the Israeli Air Force attacked targets in the Gaza Strip, at least 10 rockets were fired into southern Israel, hitting the cities of Ashkelon and Beersheba , causing no injuries. [82] Two additional rockets landed in a courtyard of a Yeshiva in Ashdod , wounding 10 people and lightly damaging the buildings. [83] [84] The Abdullah Azzam Shaheed Brigade , a radical Islamic group affiliated with Al Qaeda , claimed responsibility for the attack. [85]
August 21st rocket attacks
Perpetrators
Over 80 rockets launched from Gaza hit cities in Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding over a dozen. [88] Seven rockets were fired almost simultaneously at Beersheba . The Iron Dome rocket defense system intercepted five of them, but one hit a residential area and killed Israeli Yossi Shushan. The Lachish subdistrict was hit by 28 rockets and the Negev subdistrict was hit by nine rockets. Four Israelis from the Bnei Shimon Regional Council were injured while running for shelter in Beersheba. Three Palestinians working in Israel were injured by Grad rockets after they exploded in a field in southern Ashdod . Vehicles and homes were damaged by rockets in Israeli cities near Gaza. [89] [90]
A Grad rocket exploded near the coastal city of Ashkelon in the night, though no injuries or damage were reported. It was unknown whether the rocket was intercepted by the Iron Dome , though it was confirmed that a second rocket was intercepted. [91] On August 21, an additional 12 rockets were fired at Israel. Three were intercepted by the Iron Dome in Ashkelon. One of the rockets hit an empty high school building in Beersheba. No one was in the school because "the city had canceled educational activities in light of the missile attacks that Palestinians in Gaza have been launching against the south in the last few days" according to Beersheba deputy mayor Heftziba Zohar. Later that night, a rocket killed a dog. [92] [93] [94]
Barrages of rockets were fired at Beersheba and Ashkelon. Half of them were intercepted by the Iron Dome . Mortar shells fired at farmland in the Eshkol Regional Council contained phosphorus , which is designed to create a more intense fire after detonation. [95] 40 rockets were fired on Sunday. [96] Several structures were damaged and a car caught fire after two rockets were fired at Ashkelon. A three-month-old infant was injured by glass splinters. [97]
A 13-year-old Palestinian boy, Mahmoud Abu Samra, was killed during the rocket attacks when a Palestinian Grad rocket fell short and landed in Gaza. [81]
An informal ceasefire was agreed upon between Israel and Hamas after the Arab League held an "urgent meeting" in Cairo on August 21, 2011. [98] Some 20 minutes after the ceasefire came into effect, a barrage of Qassam rockets and mortar shells was fired at Israel. The Iron Dome intercepted two rockets fired at Ashkelon. The Israeli Air Force attacked a militant cell in the northern Gaza Strip, wounding several people. The Islamic Jihad Movement and the Popular Resistance Committees said that they would not accept a ceasefire. [99]
On August 23, four Qassam rockets were fired at Israel in breach of the ceasefire. The rockets landed in open areas and caused no casualties, but one caused a brushfire which spread to an area near two civilian communities and threatened local greenhouses . Firefighters managed to contain the blaze before it did any damage. [100]
On August 24, more than 20 rockets were fired at Israeli communities. Grad rockets targeted the cities of Beersheba, Ashkelon, and Ofakim , injuring a nine-month-old baby. In Gaza, a senior Islamic Jihad member who funded the cross-border attacks was killed and two others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a car. Israeli jets also fired at two militants after they were seen preparing to fire rockets. Several hours after the strike, two mortar shells landed in the western Negev, causing no casualties. [101] Seven rockets were fired at Southern Israel, causing no damage or casualties. The Israeli Air Force attacked an Islamic Jihad rocket-launching cell, killing one militant. According to Palestinian media, the IDF fired shells at a militant squad in eastern Gaza after a rocket attack, but the cell escaped the strike. [102] On August 25, the Islamic Jihad Movement announced that it would abide by the ceasefire. The same day, 15 rockets and mortar shells hit Southern Israel, hitting open areas near Ashkelon and in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council . A mortar shell heavily damaged the Erez Crossing Terminal . Israel responded with airstrikes on several targets in the Gaza Strip. The two Islamic Jihad militants who had launched the mortar attack on the Erez Crossing were killed by an airstrike as traveled on their motorbike in northern Gaza. [103] On August 26, two Qassam rockets hit open areas in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council , and a Grad rocket exploded near Ashkelon. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility. [104]
On August 21, 2011, media reported that the Egyptian authorities were recalling the Egyptian ambassador in Israel in response to the killing of five Egyptian security officers by Israeli soldiers after the attacks near Eilat. [105] Egypt's foreign minister later stated that "at no point was there any intention on our part to recall our ambassador to Tel Aviv." [57]
Following the media reports about the killing of the Egyptian security officers, demonstrations against Israel erupted in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy. The demonstrators threw fire crackers at the building, unfurled a Palestinian flag, and called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in response to the killings. [11] Eventually a young Egyptian, Ahmed Al-Shahhat , climbed to the roof of the apartment building which houses the Israeli Embassy and removed the Israeli flag, replacing it with an Egyptian flag he had carried with him, becoming an instant folk hero in Egypt. The Israeli flag he had taken down was burned by protesters. [106] During the demonstrations which continued for several days, thousands of protesters, shouting anti Israel slogans, called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador, the recalling of Egyptian ambassador to Israel, a review of the Camp David Accords and the opening of the border with the Gaza Strip. [26] [107] On Friday, August 26, 2011, a demonstration announced as "Million-man demonstration to expel the Israeli ambassador" took place in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy, [108] drawing a few hundred protesters according to Haaretz . [109]
Israeli apology to Egypt[ edit ]
In October 2011, the New York Times reported that Israel had sent a letter of apology to Egypt for the killing of the Egyptian security officers by Israeli forces. [12]
 Israel:
President Shimon Peres said "The series of severe terror events are an attempt by terror organizations to murder innocent civilians within Israel, and to disrupt our lives" [110]
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that this was a "serious incident in which Israeli citizens were hurt and the country's sovereignty was harmed." [111] [112]
Defense Minister Ehud Barak stated "this is a grave terrorist incident in a number of locations. The incident reflects the weakness of Egypt's hold over Sinai and the spread of terrorist elements." [113] He also blamed the attacks on Gazans and pledged that Israel will respond. "The source of the terror incidents is Gaza and we will act against them with all our strength and determination." [114] He also expressed regret over the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers and ordered the IDF to conduct a military probe of the incident, and defense officials said it would likely be a joint probe with the participation of the Egyptian military. [13]
Palestinian Authority Chief-negotiator Saeb Erekat stated "Israel stands warned of any possible aggressive action or collective punishment measures against the Palestinian population in Gaza." Erekat stated that the Palestinian Authority is "against violence in all its forms," however, he added that such attacks should not be used by Israel as "a pretext for aggression."
Hamas denied responsibility for the attacks but praised the attacks "...since they were against soldiers." [115] Hamas warned Israel not to attack the Gaza Strip, following a statement by Defense Minister Ehud Barak that the IDF would strike back at the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza following a deadly triple terror attack. Hamas evacuated its command centers and sent senior commanders into hiding in anticipation of an IDF response. [116]
Popular Resistance Committee (PRC) spokesperson praised the attacks but said his group does not take any responsibility for launching it: "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems." [117]
Tawheed and Jihad , an al-Qaeda -linked group in the Gaza Strip, praised the attacks and said the "Jewish state should expect more." Over the internet, the group said "We in the Tawheed and Jihad group bless these blessed arms that pounded the fortifications of the vendetta-filled Jewish enemy in the so-called Eilat area in southern occupied Palestine." [118] [119]
Supranational
 United Nations – UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday strongly condemned the attack but called for restraint. According to a UN statement, "the secretary-general hopes that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and brought to justice. He is concerned at the risk of escalation and calls for all to act with restraint." [121]
 European Union – EU Chief Catherine Ashton condemned the attacks, and said "I have learned with deep concern of the series of terrorist attacks that has taken place in Southern Israel today, including against civilian targets, and in which several Israelis are reported to have lost their lives and many more to have been injured. I condemn unreservedly all such acts of terror, extend my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in these attacks and express my wishes for a full and speedy recovery to the injured." [122] [123]
The Middle East Quartet in a joint statement condemned the attacks and expressed concern "about the unsustainable situation in Gaza as well as the risk of escalation", and called for "restraint from all sides". [120]
International
 Bulgaria – The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks, saying: "We express our sincere condolences to the relatives of all victims. We are convinced that violence and terrorism cannot bring peace to the Middle East. Such acts do not help the efforts of the international community to bring the participants in the Middle East peace process back to the negotiations table." [124]
 Canada – Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird condemned the attacks, saying: “Canada condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in southern Israel today. These cowardly attacks, particularly on civilian targets, are abhorrent and criminal. On behalf of all Canadians, I send my heartfelt condolences to those affected by today’s vicious attacks.” Furthermore, Baird said: "“Israel has a right to defend itself against such terrorist acts in conformity with international humanitarian law. Those responsible for these horrific attacks must be held accountable.” [125]
 Costa Rica – The Ministry of Foreign Relations published an article condemning the attack, communicating its condolences to the people of Israel, specially to the victims and families of the murdered. The article stated that Costa Rica, as a peace loving country, respectful of all human rights, expresses its most energetic disapproval of any kind of violence or terrorist attacks, regardless of the motives behind it. [126]
 Germany – Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also condemned the attacks saying: "At this difficult hour we stand by the side of our Israeli friends. Those responsible must be prosecuted. Terror and violence must not be allowed to torpedo peace and negotiation efforts in the Middle East." [127]
 Italy – Italian Foreign Affairs Minister, Franco Frattini, condemned the "barbaric" attacks on southern Israel and warned the international community to prevent more such attacks due to the unrest in the Arab world. He said: "I would like to express my condolences and closeness to the Israeli people and government for the loss of life in the barbaric attacks today." [128]
 Netherlands – The Dutch Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms." [129]
 Norway – Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Gahr Støre "condemned in the strongest possible terms" the acts of terror, adding that Norway condemns all use of terror [130]
 United Kingdom – Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said that "I condemn these appalling and senseless acts of violence. As efforts for peace in the region continue, this brutality has no place, nor its perpetrators any excuse. My thoughts and prayers are with those killed and injured and I offer sincere condolences to their families and friends."
 USA – The State Department condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms," calling the attack "brutal and cowardly." Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said "We hope that those involved in the planning of these gruesome attacks will be brought to swift justice. We stand by Israel as our friend, partner, and ally – now and always." [131] She also added that "This violence only underscores our strong concerns about the security situation in the Sinai Peninsula. Recent commitments by the Egyptian government to address the security situation in the Sinai are important and we urge the Egyptian government to find a lasting resolution." [132]
 Russia – Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman by telephone. Lavrov expressed his condolences over the terrorist attacks in southern Israel. He condemned this extremist act, and "reaffirmed the immutable position of Russia that there can be no justification for terror or for those who use it as means to achieve their ends". He also said that "despite the gravity of the crime, it is necessary to exercise restraint and to avoid retaliatory steps from which innocent people may suffer". [133]
Following the attacks on Highway 12, Israel is reportedly to soon allow Egypt to deploy thousands of troops in the Sinai Peninsula in violation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, in which both countries agreed that the Sinai Peninsula will be a military-free zone. [15]
According to Haaretz, the IDF General Staff's investigation into the attack “was a source of great frustration”. An intelligence alert from the Shin Bet had led to a massive deployment of IDF troops in the area, but the forces' alertness had eroded, allowing the militants to track the IDF and choose their infiltration route. The decision not to close the road on the morning of the attack in spite of warnings from the Shin Beth is characterised as “understandable error of judgment, and definitely not a manifestation of carelessness”, whereas the appearance of the defense minister and the chief of staff at the scene of the incident while terrorists were still in the area is considered a serious security blunder that nearly culminated in another disaster.

<h1>List of Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel, 2013 </h1>
into Israel , December 2008.
This strictly summarises the content of the article below. [2]
Month
There were no Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel in January. [3]
February 26
Palestinians fired an M-75 medium-range rocket at the Israeli city of Ashkelon . The militant wing of Fatah , the party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , claimed responsibility, calling the attack a response to the death [5] of Palestinian man Arafat Jaradat while in Israeli custody. The attack, which took place during an escalation of Palestinian violence against Israelis in the Fatah-controlled West Bank , was said to be the first of its kind since a 21 November 2012 truce and to have probably enjoyed the blessing of Hamas . Hamas denied that any rocket had been fired from the Gaza Strip. [6] [7] [8]
In March, Palestinians fired four rockets at Israel in one attack. [9]
March 21
Around 7:15 am, on the second day of a visit by US President Barack Obama in Israel, Palestinians in Beit Hanoun fired four rockets at the Israeli city of Sderot , triggering alarms in local communities and forcing residents on their way to work or school to run to bomb shelters. One rocket hit the backyard of a home in the city, spraying shrapnel into the walls and shattering windows. A second projectile landed in an open area within the surrounding Sha'ar Hanegev Regional Council . The two remaining rockets were believed to have landed within the Gaza Strip. No injuries were reported. [10] [11] [12] [13]
The Mujahedeen Shura Council , a Palestinian Salafi group, claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it was meant to show that Israeli air defenses could not stop attacks on the Jewish state. "Responding to the bragging of the Roman dog and the war criminals of their so-called Iron Dome , we assert that all their military techniques will not stop God's destiny of tormenting them", the group posted on an Islamist website. [14]
On 2 April, police found what were apparently the remains of a third rocket in a kindergarten in Sderot. The rocket had not been located previously because the kindergarten had been closed for the Passover holiday. [15]
In April, Palestinians fired 17 rockets and 5 mortar shells at Israel in 13 separate attacks. Two of the rockets were fired from Egypt . [16]
April 2
Palestinians attempted to fire two mortar shells into Israel; both landed within the Gaza Strip. Later, in the evening, a third projectile was fired into the Eshkol Regional Council . No injuries or damage were reported. [17]
The Mujahedeen Shura Council claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying they were a response to the death of Palestinian man Maysara Abuhamdia that day while in Israeli custody. The 64-year-old Abuhamdia, who was serving a life sentence for his role in a foiled plot to blow up a busy Jerusalem cafe in 2002, died of throat cancer at the Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba , Israel. His death also sparked violence by Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank . [18] [19] [20]
Israel responded to the attacks with air strikes on two targets in the Gaza Strip that night, causing no injuries. [18] This was the first such strike since Operation Pillar of Defense . Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said: "[W]e see Hamas as being responsible for everything that is fired from the Strip at Israel. We won't allow any routine involving a drizzle of rockets at our civilians and forces." [21]
April 3
Around 7:30 am, Palestinians fired two rockets at the Israeli city of Sderot . The rockets struck just as parents were dropping their children off at schools and kindergartens, triggering sirens and sending families fleeing for cover. No injuries or damage were reported. [21]
United Nations special envoy to the Middle East Robert Serry condemned the "indiscriminate firing of rockets into civilian areas" and also called on Israel to exercise restraint. [22] France said it "harshly condemns" the rocket fire on the "civilian population in south Israel". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: "If the quiet is violated, we will respond strongly". [23]
The Mujahedeen Shura Council claimed responsibility for the attack. The group also alleged that the Palestinian Hamas regime in Gaza arrested two of its members in response. Hamas denied detaining the militants, saying: "Our security apparatus is part of the resistance [i.e., warfare against Israel] and does not arrest anyone who resists the occupation. On the contrary, we encourage resistance." [24] [25]
April 4
In the early morning, Palestinians fired a rocket and three mortar shells at Israel. The rocket landed in an open area in the Eshkol Regional Council at around 2 am, triggering alarms in nearby communities, while two of the mortars fell within the Gaza Strip. No injuries or damage were reported. [26] [27]
Israeli envoy to the UN Ron Prosor called on the United Nations Security Council to condemn the rocket attacks, writing: "The time has come for the Security Council to begin to worry for the safety of Israeli citizens as well". [28]
April 7
In the evening, as Israelis began observance of the annual Holocaust Remembrance Day and during a visit by US Secretary of State John Kerry in the region, Palestinians fired three rockets at Israel. One exploded in an open area in the Sha'ar Hanegev Regional Council . The other two were believed to have fallen within the Gaza Strip. No injuries or damage were reported. [29] [30]
Following the attack, Israel partially closed its border crossings with the Gaza Strip, while keeping the Erez crossing open for humanitarian passage. [31] Israel completely reopened the crossings on 12 April. [32]
April 17
Around 9 am, two 122 mm Grad rockets were fired at the Israeli resort city of Eilat on the Red Sea coast, triggering alarms. The rockets were believed to have been fired from Egypt 's adjacent Sinai Peninsula . One of the rockets exploded in a construction site in the residential neighborhood of Shahamon, while the other fell adjacent to the main hotel strip, near the Jordanian border. No physical injuries or damage were reported, but a number of residents suffered from acute stress reaction . The attack forced a temporary complete closure of Eilat Airport . An Iron Dome battery that had been stationed by the city did not intercept the rockets. Two rockets also landed in Jordan 's neighboring resort city of Aqaba . [33] [34] [35] [36]
The Mujahideen Shura Council claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they had targeted "occupied Eilat" [sic] as a "response to the continued suffering of the downtrodden prisoners in Israeli jails". [37]
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said that Israel would respond to the attack, as was the country's consistent policy for the past four years. [38] [39]
April 18
Around 11 pm, Palestinians fired two rockets into the Eshkol Regional Council . No injuries or damage were reported. The Color Red alarm failed to sound. [40]
April 21
Before daybreak, Palestinians fired a rocket into the Eshkol Regional Council , triggering sirens in nearby towns and forcing residents into bomb shelters. No injuries or damage were reported. [41] [42]
April 27
On the evening of the Jewish Lag BaOmer holiday, Palestinians fired a rocket into the Sdot Negev Regional Council . The projectile exploded near a residential area but caused no injuries or damage. Israeli children who were celebrating the holiday with bonfires were instructed to return home. [43] [44]
Israel responded to the attack with air strikes on two sites in the southern Gaza Strip belonging to the militant wing of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine : a training facility and a weapons storage site, causing no injuries. It also temporarily closed the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip for commercial goods, keeping it open exclusively for humanitarian passage. The Israel Defense Forces stated that it "will not tolerate any attempt to harm Israeli civilians, and will not allow for a return to the reality before Pillar of Defense where Israeli civilians are threatened". [45] [46] [47]
April 29
Before daybreak, Palestinians fired a rocket into the Eshkol Regional Council . The projectile exploded in an open area and caused no injuries or damage. The Color Red alarm sounded in nearby communities. [48] [49]
April 30
The Palestinian Ansar Brigades claimed to have launched 5 mortar shells at the Israeli towns of Kerem Shalom and Holit (in the Eshkol Regional Council). No mortar hits were observed in Israel, however, and it was suggested that the projectiles all fell within the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian group said the attacks on the towns were a response to Israel's targeted killing of Haitham al-Mishal, a terrorist involved in the recent rocket attack on Eilat. "The occupation does not respect the truce nor fulfill its commitments," the group said in a statement. "The truce can go to hell." [50] [51]
In May, Palestinians carried out three attacks on Israel, firing 1 rocket and four mortars. [52]
May 2
In the evening, Palestinians fired two mortar shells into the Eshkol Regional Council . The projectiles landed in open areas, causing no injuries or damage. [53]
May 15
As Israelis celebrated the holiday of Shavuot , Palestinians fired a rocket into the Eshkol Regional Council, triggering the Color Red alarm. The projectile landed in an open area, causing no injuries or damage. The attack occurred as Palestinians marked Nakba Day and coincided with widespread Palestinian violence against Israelis in Jerusalem and the West Bank. [54] [55]
In a separate incident that took place in the morning, two mortar shells were fired from Syria at Mount Hermon in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights . The shells landed in open areas, causing no injuries or damage, but forcing a closure of the area to hikers for several hours. A previously unknown Palestinian Islamist group calling itself the Abdul Qader al-Husseini brigades claimed responsibility for the launchings, saying that its motive was "avenging all our martyrs that we lost in our war with the Zionist enemy". Mortar shells fired from Syria had landed in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in several previous incidents, but all of these were presumed to be accidental fallout from the Syrian civil war . [56] [57]
In June, Palestinians launched 5 rockets at Israel in 3 separate attacks. [58]
June 19
Around 5:40 am, as world leaders were gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the 90th birthday of Israeli President Shimon Peres , Palestinian terrorists fired one to three rockets toward the coastal city of Ashkelon , triggering sirens in the city and in surrounding communities. The rockets apparently landed within the Gaza Strip, and no injuries or damage were reported. [59] [60]
June 23/24
Overnight, Palestinians fired rockets at the city of Netivot , the Bnei Shimon Regional Council , and the Ashkelon Coast Regional Council . Two of the projectiles were intercepted by Iron Dome . Air raid sirens sounded as far as Beersheba , Rahat and Lahavim . No injuries or damage were reported. Palestinian Islamic Jihad was believed to be behind the attacks, and their motivation was thought to be internal tension in the Gaza Strip after an Islamic Jihad leader was killed by Hamas police the previous day.
Israel responded the same night with air strikes on two arms depots in the central Gaza Strip, a rocket launching site, and a terror activity site in the southern part of the Strip. It also temporarily closed the Kerem Shalom and Erez border crossings between Israel and Gaza for commercial passage. [61] [62] [63]
In July, Palestinians launched 5 rockets and 2 mortars at Israel in 6 separate attacks. Five of the rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip and two originated from the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. [64]
July 4
A rocket was fired from Egypt at Eilat . Israelis reported hearing several explosions in the area, and the remains of a rocket were found five days later. [65]

August 13
In the evening, Palestinians fired two rockets at Sderot . One exploded in an open area outside the city, triggering sirens, and another fell within the Gaza Strip. No injuries or damage were reported. The incident occurred just as Israel was releasing, as a concession in the renewed peace talks, a group of Palestinian prisoners convicted of murder, and less than 24 hours after Islamist militants in Egypt fired a Grad rocket at the Israeli resort town of Eilat. [72] [73] Israel responded with air strikes on rocket launching sites in the northern Gaza Strip. [74]

<h1>Israel’s Secret Iran Attack Plan: Electronic Warfare - The </h1>
Israel has been building stealthy, multibillion-dollar electronic weapons that could be deployed if Israel attacks Iran's nuclear sites, U.S. intelligence officials tell Eli Lake.
For much of the last decade, as Iran methodically built its nuclear program, Israel has been assembling a multibillion-dollar array of high-tech weapons that would allow it to jam, blind, and deafen Tehran's defenses in the case of a pre-emptive aerial strike. 
A U.S. intelligence assessment this summer, described to The Daily Beast by current and former U.S. intelligence officials, concluded that any Israeli attack on hardened nuclear sites in Iran would go far beyond airstrikes from F-15 and F-16 fighter planes and likely include electronic warfare against Iran’s electric grid, Internet, cellphone network, and emergency frequencies for firemen and police officers. 
For example, Israel has developed a weapon capable of mimicking a maintenance cellphone signal that commands a cell network to “sleep,” effectively stopping transmissions, officials confirmed. The Israelis also have jammers capable of creating interference within Iran’s emergency frequencies for first responders. 
In a 2007 attack on a suspected nuclear site at al-Kibar, the Syrian military got a taste of this warfare when Israeli planes “spoofed” the country’s air-defense radars, at first making it appear that no jets were in the sky and then in an instant making the radar believe the sky was filled with hundreds of planes.
Israel also likely would exploit a vulnerability that U.S. officials detected two years ago in Iran's big-city electric grids, which are not “air-gapped”—meaning they are connected to the Internet and therefore vulnerable to a Stuxnet-style cyberattack —officials say. 
A highly secretive research lab attached to the U.S. joint staff and combatant commands, known as the Joint Warfare Analysis Center (JWAC), discovered the weakness in Iran’s electrical grid in 2009, according to one retired senior military intelligence officer. This source also said the Israelis have the capability to bring a denial-of-service attack to nodes of Iran’s command and control system that rely on the Internet.
Tony Decarbo, the executive officer for JWAC, declined comment for this story.  The likely delivery method for the electronic elements of this attack would be an unmanned aerial vehicle the size of a jumbo jet. An earlier version of the bird was called the Heron, the latest version is known as the Eitan. According to the Israeli press, the Eitan can fly for 20 straight hours and carry a payload of one ton. Another version of the drone, however, can fly up to 45 straight hours, according to U.S. and Israeli officials.  
Unmanned drones have been an integral part of U.S. wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, gathering intelligence and firing missiles at suspected insurgents. But Israel's fleet has been specially fitted for electronic warfare, according to officials.
“They would have to take out radar and anti-aircraft. They could also attack with missiles and their drone fleet.”
The Eitans and Herons would also likely be working with a special Israeli air force unit known as the Sky Crows, which focuses only on electronic warfare. A 2010 piece in The Jerusalem Post quoted the commander of the electronic warfare unit as saying, “Our objective is to activate our systems and to disrupt and neutralize the enemy’s systems.”
Fred Fleitz, who left his post this year as a Republican senior staffer who focused on Iran at the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in his meetings with Israeli defense and intelligence officials, they would always say all options were on the table. 
"I think Israel has the capabilities with their air force and mid-air refueling to take on these sites," said Fleitz, who is now managing editor of Lignet.com. "They would have to take out radar and anti-aircraft. They could also attack with missiles and their drone fleet." 
Whatever Israel ultimately decides to do about Iran’s program, one mission for now is clear. A senior Israeli official told The Daily Beast this month that one important objective of Israel's political strategy on Iran was to persuade Iranian decision makers that a military strike against their nuclear infrastructure was a very real possibility. "The only known way to stop a nuclear program is to have smashing sanctions with a credible military threat. Libya is the best example of this," this official said.
At the same time, if past practice is any guide, the Israelis would not likely strike at the same moment that their officials are discussing the prospect in the press. In other words, if Israel is openly discussing a military strike, it is unlikely to be imminent.
But if Israel goes radio silent—like it did in when it attacked a suspected nuclear site in Iraq in 1981—that may be an early warning sign that a strike is nearing.  
When Sam Lewis was U.S. ambassador to Israel during the transition from the Carter to Reagan administrations, he warned the new administration there was a chance then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin might bomb the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq.
“I had given a full alert to the new administration about the dangers,” Lewis recalled in an interview. “We’d been having discussions with the Israelis about how they wanted to stop the project, there was a lot of news and then it all dried up.”
Lewis and his staff had moved on. Then without warning on June 7, 1981, in something called Operation Opera, Israeli jets flew in late afternoon via Jordanian airspace and incinerated the nuclear facility that was under construction southeast of Baghdad. “I did feel after the fact that we should have assumed this bombing was going to take place,” Lewis said. “After it was over, I was not surprised, I was annoyed by having been misled by the quiet as it were.”
There may be a lesson for the Obama administration as it tries to calibrate what Israel will do on Iran. Since taking office, the president has made major efforts to avoid any surprises in the relationship with Israel, particularly on the issue of Iran. Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for example, tasked their first national security advisers to establish an unprecedented system for regular consultation between the two countries, featuring regular video-teleconferences.
They formed a standing committee on Iran as well, to check the progress of sanctions, share intelligence, and keep both sides informed. Despite all of this, Netanyahu has refused to give any assurance to Obama or his top cabinet advisers that he would inform or ask permission before launching an attack on Iran that would likely spur the Iranians to launch a terrorist attack on the United States or Israel in response, according to U.S. and Israeli officials familiar with these meetings. The Telegraph first reported the tension over the weekend .
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta "expressed the desire for consultation on any contemplated future Israeli military action, and [Ehud] Barak understood the U.S. position,” said one official familiar with the discussions.
The Israelis may be coy this time around because of the experience of then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. In 2007, the Israelis presented what they considered to be rock-solid evidence that Syria was building a covert nuclear facility at al-Kibar. They asked President Bush to bomb the facility, according to the new memoir from Condoleezza Rice.
“The president decided against a strike and suggested a diplomatic course to the Israeli prime minister,” she wrote. “Ehud Olmert thanked us for our input but rejected our advice, and the Israelis then expertly did the job themselves.”
One American close to the current prime minister said, “When Netanyahu came into office, the understanding was they will not make the same mistake that Olmert made and ask for something the president might say no to. Better to ask forgiveness than to ask permission.”

It borders Paraguay and Bolivia to the north, Brazil and Uruguay to the northeast, and Chile to the west and south. Argentine claims over Antarctica , as well as overlapping claims made by Chile and the United Kingdom , are suspended by the Antarctic Treaty of 1961. Argentina also claims the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas) and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands , which are administered by the United Kingdom as British Overseas Territories .
A recognised middle power , Argentina is Latin America's third-largest economy, with a "very high" rating on the Human development index . Within Latin America, Argentina has the fifth highest nominal GDP per capita and the highest in purchasing power terms . Analysts have argued that the country has a "foundation for future growth due to its market size, levels of foreign direct investment, and percentage of high-tech exports as share of total manufactured goods", and it is classed by investors as middle emerging economy . Argentina is a founding member of the United Nations, Mercosur , the Union of South American Nations , the Organization of Ibero-American States , the World Bank Group and the World Trade Organization , and is one of the G-15 and G-20 major economies .

Israeli military GAME CHANGER to combat IED attacks
Finally after many lives lost due to IED attacks the Israeli military has unveiled new technology to render IED useless. Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), unveils its new CIMS (Counter IED and Mine Suite) - an integrated suite of sensors, for protection of tactical maneuvering vehicles. CIMS will be displayed at the 2014 Annual Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Meeting & Exposition in Washington DC, from October 13-15, 2014 (IAI North America - Booth #2039). Although mines and IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) are not new to the war scene, the use of these devices has become a matter of concern for modern armies both in regular and assymetric warfare. The CIMS suite was designed under the premise that no one sensor can provide the adequate probability of detection and low false-alarm rate required by today's operational needs. The CIMS suite detects both surface and underground IEDs, mines, and roadside bombs, and consists of an ADS - Above-surface Detection System, and MIDS - underground Mine and IED Detection System. The ADS includes a groundbreaking side-looking SAR radar, high-resolution optical detection system and an infrared multispectral investigation system. MIDS comprises a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and a magnetic detector. Integration of the sensor suite through a central processing and management system delivers accurate synergetic real-time mapping of IED threats to the warfighter, requiring minimal training and decision-making. The CIMS suite and its subsystems can be adapted to any combat tactical vehicle. "CIMS was designed first and foremost to save lives," said Nissim Hadas, IAI VP & ELTA President. "Our combination of unique sensors allows a simple and highly effective mine and IED detection system to be provided to forward forces. We see huge potential for this system and consider it to be a groundbreaking solution." An improvised explosive device (IED) is a bomb constructed and deployed in ways other than in conventional military action. It may be constructed of conventional military explosives, such as an artillery round, attached to a detonating mechanism. Roadside bombs are a common use of IEDs. IEDs are generally seen in heavy terrorist actions or in unconventional warfare by guerrillas or commando forces in a theater of operations. In the second Iraq War, IEDs were used extensively against US-led invasion forces and by the end of 2007 they had become responsible for approximately 63% of coalition deaths in Iraq.[1] They are also used in Afghanistan by insurgent groups, and have caused over 66% of coalition casualties in the 2001–present Afghanistan War.[2] IEDs were also used extensively by cadres of the rebel Tamil Tiger (LTTE) organization against military targets in Sri Lanka.[3][4] Background The term Improvised Explosive Device comes from the British Army in the 1970s, after the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) used bombs made from agricultural fertilizer and semtex smuggled from Libya to make highly effective boobytrap devices or remote-controlled bombs. An IED is a bomb fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals and designed to destroy or incapacitate personnel or vehicles. In some cases, IEDs are used to distract, disrupt, or delay an opposing force, facilitating another type of attack.[5] IEDs may incorporate military or commercially sourced explosives, and often combine both types, or they may otherwise be made with homemade explosives (HME). An IED has five components: a switch (activator), an initiator (fuse), container (body), charge (explosive), and a power source (battery). An IED designed for use against armoured targets such as personnel carriers or tanks will be designed for armour penetration, by using a shaped charge that creates an explosively formed penetrator. IEDs are extremely diverse in design, and may contain many types of initiators, detonators, penetrators, and explosive loads. Antipersonnel IEDs typically also contain fragmentation-generating objects such as nails, ball bearings or even small rocks to cause wounds at greater distances than blast-pressure alone could. IEDs are triggered by various methods, including remote control, infra-red or magnetic triggers, pressure-sensitive bars or trip wires (victim-operated). In some cases, multiple IEDs are wired together in a daisy-chain, to attack a convoy of vehicles spread out along a roadway. IEDs made by inexperienced designers or with substandard materials may fail to detonate, and in some cases actually detonate on either the maker or the emplacer of the device (these unintended early detonations are known as pre-detonations, "own goals", or "self-resolving bomb-tech removal" if the placer is killed in the detonation). Some groups, however, have been known to produce sophisticated devices that are constructed

If Israel could do this to a young American Jew, imagine what Palestinians face every day [MFV !]
MFV : [Make Facts Viral !] http://www.palestinenews1.org/#!home/mainPage The true face of the supposed "only democracy in the Middle East". A young American Jew quietly and calmly voices his opposition to Israel's policies towards the Palestinians, both in the occupied territories and in Israel itself, and is attacked by the Israeli police, who drag him along the road face down and throw him into a police van. American jewish boy roughly man handled and arrested in Jerusalem for sticking up for the Palestinians during jewish march. YouTube is deleting user accounts who have this video. I suggest people copy/download this video and spread it around themselves if my account is also deleted. ~~LET THE TRUTH BE KNOWN, SPREAD THIS VIDEO AROUND~~ Police violently arresting a Jewish teenager in Jerusalem for speaking the truth and charged him for "attacking and biting a police officer" !!! For one American Jewish teenager, this year's Jerusalem Day earlier this month turned out to be an event not to remember, as he was detained for two days on suspicion of attacking and biting a police officer. "Lucas," a 19 year-old from Philadelphia, cut a rather different figure in the Jerusalem Day flag parade in the capital. Like many participants in the event, he wore a skullcap on his head; unlike the others, however, a Palestinian flag and a keffiyeh were also part of his outfit. The youth, who arrived in Israel as part of a trip arranged by a Jewish-Christian group, claims he was attacked by a policeman during the celebrations. The parade turned ugly this year when a small group of participants walked through East Jerusalem, and the Old City's Muslim Quarter, chanting "death to Arabs." Lucas, with a few comrades, stood opposite these demonstrators, and shouted out slogans in support of ending Israel's occupation of the territories. He says that dozens of Palestinians gathered behind him, and formed a spontaneous protest. In a videotape, Lucas can be seen refusing to give policemen his passport, after he was apparently identified as the leader of the protest. After a few minutes, in the clip, a police officer is seen dragging Lucas forcibly into a police car, "Israel is occupying the Palestinian people in my name, in the name of world Jewry," Lucas, clutching his American passport, tells the camera. "And I myself, an American Jew, is here to say that is completely unjustified and ethically reprehensible. "And we, world Jewry and all people of the world, will not stop until this occupation ends and until the Palestinian people have their right - the right of return, the right to live without occupation, and equal rights within Israel. That is why we are here." Israel Police claims the young man attacked and bit an officer - however, the video does not show Lucas provoking any officers. It shows a group of policemen forcing him to the ground and handcuffing him; as a result, he required medical treatment afterward. For his part, Lucas adamantly denies that he attacked a police officer. "I didn't bite anyone," he says. "The police officer showed me his cuts [later], but they were caused by a sharp instrument, and there weren't any bite marks." Lucas was held in detention for two days. The Jerusalem Magistrate's Court denied a police request to extend his remand; at the advice of his lawyer and family, the youth left the country after being released.

Christopher Bollyn 2015 “Solving 911 Ends the War”
Christopher Bollyn 2015 “Solving 911 Ends the War” In the name of 9/11, “wars have been waged, governments overthrown, and an untold number of lives sacrificed.” Yet 9/11 is an unsolved crime of terrorism and mass murder, with no trial and no serious investigation. This elaborately planned criminal deception was carried out “with the intention that the public would be deceived with a false explanation blaming the atrocity on Osama Bin Laden and Al Quaida....” Christopher Bollyn states he has written “Solving 9-11: the Deception that Changed the World” because he could not remain indifferent and silent...”as the lies about 9/11 were used to wage wars of aggression and transform American into a police state.” An investigative journalist from Illinois, Bollyn sojourned in Europe and the Middle East before studying languages, history and journalism at UC Davis and Santa Cruz. His degree in history focused on the Israeli occupation of Palestine. He has written in-depth articles about the Middle East, electronic vote fraud, the dangers of depleted uranium, and the history and geo-political background of 9/11. In 2007, Bollyn and his family moved to Sweden when his research into 9/11 brought about his being attacked by undercover police and then charged with assaulting them. He began writing this book and has been touring in the US with the hope of raising the consciousness of the American public and exposing the true culprits. Readers of his book have said it is “the top-notch work of the 9/11 collection and ...the work of a brave genius...information we can use to reformulate our worldview....gives me hope that truth and liberty can ultimately prevail.” More information at www.bollyn.com. -- Tags: 911, Christopher Bollyn, Solving 911, Jewish Lightning, Sayanim, Agents, Assets -- Produced: 2015, Episode: CD-S911, 57:58, Category: Education -- Phone your local public TV station and ask them to broadcast this film to your local community.

[WW3] IRAN WARNS ISRAEL & US against ATTACK by flexing MILITARY MUSCLE in TEHRAN parade
TEHRAN: Iran warned Israel and the United States against any aggression, as it proudly paraded its troops and military hardware on Friday under the gaze of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and top brass. The Tehran parade, involving thousands of military personnel, dozens of tanks and missiles borne on trucks, marked the anniversary of the start of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. Ahmadinejad, in a speech broadcast on state television, said that Iran was using "the same spirit and belief in itself" shown in that war to "stand and defend its rights" today against pressure from world powers. Top Iranian generals said the show of military might should be digested by Israel, which in recent weeks has ramped up threats that it could hit Iranian nuclear facilities. "We do not feel threatened by the nonsense uttered by that regime's leaders," the chief of Iran's armed forces, General Hassan Firouzabadi, told the Fars news agency, adding that Iran's response to any attack would be "immediate and unstoppable." General Ataollah Selehi, the commander of Iran's army, told the ISNA news agency that "us holding a military parade is for deterrence and not a threat." He and other military leaders renewed their pledge that Israel would be annihilated if attacked. The head of the Revolutionary Guards' aerospace division in charge of missile defence, Brigadier General Amir Ali Hahjizadeh, repeated Iran's promise to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz if the Islamic republic were attacked or western sanctions halted its crude exports. "If one day the Strait of Hormuz has no benefit for us, then we will deprive others from benefiting from it," he said. However he added that "under current conditions, there is no problem." Hahjizadeh also dismissed navy war games currently being held by the United States and 30 other nations in the Gulf as "no threat to us." Iran is locked in a showdown with the UN Security Council over its controversial nuclear programme. Iran and the UN Security Council are locked in a showdown over Tehran's disputed nuclear programme. The west, led by the United States, has tightened the vice on Iran by implementing crippling economic sanctions, while Israel -- the Middle East's sole if undeclared nuclear weapons state -- has underlined its threats of possible air strikes on Iranian atomic facilities, with or without US help. In his speech, Ahmadinejad also touched on an anti-Islam film made in America by an extremist Christian group that has fuelled violent protests in parts of the Muslim world. He said US government claims it could do nothing to censor the film was a "deception" exploiting the pretext of freedom of expression. He called the film an Israeli-hatched plot "to divide (Muslims) and spark sectarian conflict." Ahmadinejad implicitly referred to his often expressed opinion that the Holocaust never happened to lambast the west for perceived selective censorship. "They stand against a question about a historical incident ... they threaten and put pressure on nations for posing the question while at the same time in regards to the obscenest insults to the human sanctities and prophets... they shout adherence to freedom (of expression)," he said. Ahmadinejad's stance challenging the facts surrounding the killing of six million Jews by the Nazi regime during World War II is shared by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the country's commander-in-chief. Early this week, Khamenei told naval cadets: "In some western countries, no one dares to question the unknown incident of the Holocaust or for that matter some of the morally obscene policies like homosexuality ... but insulting Islam and its sanctities under the pretext of freedom of expression is allowed."

Ezra Levant - Calgary Muslim pleads guilty to attacking Jewish girl
One of four pro-Palestinian protesters charged in connection with a dust up with Israel supporters in Calgary pleaded guilty to assault Wednesday for sucker-punching a woman. The offender, who was 17 at the time and can’t be named, admitted striking Samantha Hamilton once in the face as she went to assist her brother, who was being attacked. Defence counsel Rame Katrib entered a guilty plea on behalf of the now 18-year-old before youth court Judge Richard O’Gorman. Crown prosecutor Carla MacPhail, who said she will not be seeking any custody, read in a statement of agreed facts signed by Katrib and his client. She said the altercation took place during a rally by Palestine supporters outside the Municipal Building on Macleod Tr. S. in the early evening of July 18. “The protesters were chanting slogans, displaying Palestinian flags, pro-Palestinian signs and placards,” MacPhail said. “In view of the protesters, the Israeli military action in Gaza was unjustified and had resulted in the deaths of innocents, including women and children,” she said of the highly charged event. “During the protest, a group of approximately 15 people who are supporters of the Israeli government arrived,” MacPhail told O’Gorman. Hamilton, 22, and her brother Shane, 19, were part of the group of “counter-protesters,” the prosecutor said. A heated exchange ensued between people other than the youth and the Hamiltons which resulted in a pro-Palestinian grabbing an Israeli flag and stomping on it. MacPhail said many in the crowd took cell phone videos of the events. “These videos depict shouting ... which turned quickly into physical altercations,” she said. “At one point Shane Hamilton ... was on the ground being struck and kicked by a number of individuals,” said MacPhail, adding the young offender was not alleged to be involved in that assault. “As Samantha Hamilton went to her brother’s aid, she suffered one blow, a punch, to the front left side of her face which was delivered by (the teen),” she said. “She then felt another blow to the back of her head and had her hair pulled. “These were not delivered by (the teen).” MacPhail said the physical violence, which resulted in three adults also being charged, lasted less than two minutes. She said Calgary police were not in attendance as a previous protest by the Palestinian group had ended peacefully. A sentencing hearing is set for Jan. 26.

Sinai: Yom Kippur 1973 - Israeli tanks win the war with Arik Sharon.
(From "Greatest Tank Battles") Defeat seemed to be imminent for the state of Israel. The Syrians’ Soviet-style massive frontal assault was too much to bear, and the Israeli front lines had already collapsed. The Israeli general in charge of the entire front had abandoned his nearly surrounded headquarters (HQ) and retired to a makeshift command post a few kilometers back. With two Syrian brigades advancing on the headquarters and no Israeli reserves in sight, defending the headquarters–left in the hands of infantrymen supported by only two trackless tanks mustered from the camp’s repair depot–seemed almost futile. On October 6, 1973, during Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, a Syrian armored force of 1,400 tanks backed by more than 1,000 artillery pieces and supporting air power began a coordinated assault along the 36-mile-long Israeli-Syrian border in the Golan Heights in the north of Israel. That attack coincided with a similar onslaught by Egyptian forces along the Suez Canal, suddenly forcing Israel to fight a two-front war. This prompted Arik Sharon to launch Operation Abiray-Lev (Stouthearted Men) the next day, penetrating the Egyptian line of defense and crossing the Suez Canal.

2009 Jakarta bombings
Contents
Since the 2002 Bali bombings , in which over 200 were killed, Indonesia has stepped up attempts to crack down on terrorism. An anti-terrorism law was confirmed by the Indonesian legislature in 2003. [11] The 2002 attack was carried out by Jemaah Islamiyah , an al-Qaeda -linked group seeking to unite Indonesia, Malaysia , and the southern Philippines under an Islamic state. [12] [13]
The Marriott bombing occurred first and was followed five minutes later by the Ritz bombing. [5] Police moved to seal off the surrounding area. [5] At noon local time, an unexploded bomb was found in room 1808 of the Marriott, together with "bomb-making equipment". [15] [16] [17]
The Ritz-Carlton explosion is thought to have originated in the Airlangga Restaurant on the second story, [5] [6] where people were eating breakfast. [2] There was said to be glass everywhere. [5] A part of the facade of the Ritz Carlton was blown away by the blast and windows had been blown out.
The Marriott bombing occurred during one of a series of periodic breakfast meetings of CEOs and other prominent (and predominantly expatriate) members of the Jakarta business community hosted by James Castle, president of AmCham Indonesia, a branch of the United States Chamber of Commerce in Jakarta. [4] [18] The Marriott bomb was detonated in a small breakfast room rented for the event, and not in the main restaurant. [18] One witness said the lobby of the neighboring Plaza Mutiara building was destroyed in the explosion. [5]
The unexploded bomb in room 1808 of the JW Marriott hotel was programmed to go off prior to the other bomb there, but its timer malfunctioned. The Indonesian police believe the bomb was intended to create an atmosphere of panic, causing guests to flee their rooms to exit the hotel, and generating a significant crowd in the lobby. Had this occurred as planned, the lobby bomb may have taken a much greater toll. [19]
There were nine fatalities; three Australians, one New Zealander, two Dutch tourists, and three Indonesians (including two suicide bombers). [2] [6] [20] The Australians killed were Austrade official Craig Senger, mining executive Garth McEvoy and Perth businessman Nathan Verity. [21] New Zealander Tim Mackay died; he was president/director of PT Holcim Indonesia and a master mariner. [22] Indonesians killed included Evert Mokodompis, a waiter at the JW Marriott Hotel. [23]
Sixteen foreigners were treated at Metropolitan Medical Center (MMC) hospital. [24] A New Zealander, a Canadian, an Indian and 3 Dutch men were reported injured. [25] [26]
Police believe planning for the bombings was led by Noordin M. Top . The first meeting had been held on April 30. Ibrohim, a florist who worked for a florist company which had stores in both the bombed hotels, was another key organiser. Ibrohim was recruited in 2000 by Saifudin Jaelani (aka Saifudin Zuhri bin Jaelani Irsyad), his brother-in-law, while he was working as a florist at the Hotel Mulia in Jakarta. In 2005, Ibrohim and Jaelani were inaugurated as members of Noordin's special forces. Ibrohim set strategies, conducted surveys of the locations and smuggled the bombs into the hotels. Saifudin Jaelani is believed to have also recruited the suicide bombers for the operation.
The bombs were smuggled into the JW Marriott one day before the blast through the hotel's loading dock using a pick-up truck rented by Ibrohim. The bomb design and materials of an unexploded bomb found by Police in room 1808 were identical to those used by Jemaah Islamiyah in previous attacks. [27]
The suicide bomber of the JW Marriott Hotel was Dani Dwi Permana, an 18-year-old graduate of a private senior high school in Bogor , West Java . The suicide bomber of the Ritz-Carlton hotel was Nana Ikhwan Maulana, a 28-year-old former resident of Pandeglang , Banten . Dani rented room 1808 in the JW Marriott. The room was paid for by Amir Abdillah, who was arrested on August 5.
On August 7, police raided a house in Temanggung , Central Java . Three people were arrested and one person was killed, later identified to be Ibrohim. On August 8, police raided a house in Bekasi , West Java , killing two people believed to be preparing to attack the Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono with a truck bomb near his private residence in Bogor , West Java .
Funding for the bombings is believed to have been provided from the Middle East. A number of suspects, including a Saudi Arabian national, have been arrested by Indonesian police for their involvement in handling the funds.
The bombings were deplored by numerous governments—in Indonesia, elsewhere in the region, and around the world. [2] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] President Barack Obama, who spent a portion of his childhood in Jakarta stated, "I strongly condemn the attacks that occurred this morning in Jakarta, and extend my deepest condolences to all of the victims and their loved ones. The US government stands ready to help the Indonesian government respond to and recover from these outrageous attacks as a friend and partner." [35]
Manchester United , which had been scheduled to play an exhibition football match in Jakarta on 20 July 2009 and had booked rooms at the Ritz Carlton, cancelled the Jakarta leg of its tour. [5] [14]
The hotel was closed for 2 weeks and reopened to the public on Monday, 3 August 2009 at 10:00 WIB . The 17th United States Ambassador to Indonesia 's Cameron R. Hume attended the reopening of Hotel J.W. Marriott and Ritz Carlton on Wednesday, 29 July 2009 in Jakarta . The ambassador visited both hotels.

Contents
Two weeks prior to the bombing, there was a tip call to senior Indonesian police officers from a militant captured during a raid in Semarang that two carloads of bomb-making materials were heading to the capital, Jakarta . During the raid, the police also discovered some drawings outlining specific areas in the city for possible attacks. [2]
A Toyota Kijang , bought on 20 July 2003, from a Jakarta businessman for 25.75 million rupiah [3] was loaded with explosives and driven through the taxi stand in front of the Marriott Hotel. The vehicle stopped briefly in front of the lobby and CCTV cameras show a security guard approaching the vehicle, briefly speaking to the driver. The security guard then turns and a detonation can be seen. It is still not clear if the explosion was accidental, set off by remote detonation or a timer exploding prematurely. If the vehicle had kept a course heading straight for the lobby the damage would undoubtedly have been more severe. The blast radius was visible along the shattered windows of nearby buildings. According to Indonesian police, one of the ingredients in the car bomb contained the same chemical [4] used in the deadly 2002 Bali bombings . [5] The bombs in both cases were made of the same mixture of explosives, mobile phones were used as detonators, and the attackers had tried to scrape off the identification numbers from the vehicle bombs. [3]
The severed head of Asmar Latin Sani , aged 28, and from West Sumatra , was later found on the fifth floor of the building, [6] The head was identified by two jailed members of the Jemaah Islamiyah group who said they had recruited him. [4]
Investigators uncovered the charred remains of a battery used to power the bomb and said it was similar to the ones used in a series of bombings against Christian churches on Christmas Eve 2000, in which 19 people were killed. [3]
The attack came two days before a verdict in the trial of the Bali nightclub bombers. Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack and the perpetrators are known to have trained in al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan . [7]
“
”
Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), an organisation affiliated with al-Qaeda , is alleged to have carried out the bombing. The al-Qaeda link has been backed by Indonesia's Minister of Defense , Matori Abdul Djalil who said the Marriott bombers had trained with al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan . "Each one of them has special abilities received from training in Afghanistan and Pakistan," Matori Abdul Djalil said on 11 August 2003. He also claimed that the bombers were linked to a group of people arrested in the eastern Indonesian town of Semarang during July 2004 and are alleged to be members of Jemaah Islamiah.
"There are many more Jemaah Islamiah members on the loose in Indonesia ... Because of this I am sure that JI is behind all of this,"
On 5 May 2006 the International Crisis Group released its Asia Report No 114 entitled Terrorism in Indonesia. It described the events leading up the attack;
The trigger for the Marriott bombing came in December 2002, when Indonesian police stepped up the hunt for Jemaah Islamiyah members while investigating the 2002 Bali bombings . Toni Togar , a JI member based in Medan , North Sumatra , was nervous, because his house stored all the explosives left over from JI's 2000 Christmas Eve bombings . He contacted Noordin Mohammad Top to tell him he was going to throw them out. Noordin previously was part of the team that carried out the Christmas Eve bombings which was led by Hambali and included Imam Samudra and many of the other 2002 Bali bombers. He told Togar to hold on as he "saw good materials being wasted".
Abu Bakar Bashir approved of Hambali's activities, and Toni Togar was selected to take part in the new bombing plot. Hambali had already set a precedent for a secret team pursuing jihad on its own. This was in part because he controlled the separate funding from al-Qaeda . In January 2003, Muhammad Rais , Noordin and Azahari Husin moved to Bengkulu , where a group of JI members lived, including Asmar Latin Sani , who became the Marriott suicide bomber. The next stages of the operation took place in February 2003 when the explosives were transported from Dumai to Bengkulu via Pekanbaru ,
Azahari secured the detonators with a new team member, Masrizal bin Ali Umar . also known as Tohir, another Pondok Ngruki graduate and a Luqmanul Hakiem teacher who was a close friend of Rais. After the explosives safely reached Bengkulu as unaccompanied baggage on an intercity bus, they were stored at the house of Sardona Siliwangi , another Ngruki student and JI member. At the time, Sardona, who was working with Asmar Latin Sani, opened a bank account in March 2003 to facilitate financial transactions for Noordin.
In late April 2003, Mohamed Ihsan also known as Gembrot and Idris , who was involved in the 2000 Christmas Eve bombings transported the explosives again. In May, he and Toni Togar, robbed a bank in Medan on 6 May to raise funds for the project. "Ismail", a Luqmanul Hakiem student who had previously worked with Rais and Noordin in the shock absorber repair shop in Bukittinggi , then received an email from Noordin asking him to pick up some packages from a man in Dumai . Ismail obliged, and the package turned out to be cash in Australian dollars , sent by Hambali via a courier.
A book that appears based in part on transcripts of Hambali's interrogation says Hambali arranged for A$25,000 to be sent: A$15,000 for operational expenses, A$10,000 for Bali bomber families. Conboy, op. cit., p. 229. Hambali's younger brother, Rusman Gunawan , who was arrested in Karachi in September 2003, testified Hambali had secured a promise of A$50,000 from an Noordin on how to bring the cash from Dumai to Lampung .
On 4 June 2003, in Lampung, the final team was put together: Noordin, Azhari, Ismail, Asmar Latin Sani, and Tohir. Noordin assigned the tasks and explained that he was in charge, Azhari was field commander and Ismail his assistant. Asmar and Tohir would be in charge of renting the house, buying the vehicles and getting the explosives to Jakarta . Asmar had agreed to be the suicide bomber . When they got to Jakarta, they split into two teams to survey four possible targets. Azhari and Ismail examined the Marriott and a Citibank branch; Noordin and Tohir looked at the Jakarta International School and the Australian International School . Eventually they decided on the hotel because of the American brand name and the fact that it was easy to reach. The bombing took place on 5 August.
They all drove back to Blitar with 25 kilograms of potassium chlorate and ten kilos of sulfur for bomb making, as well as a pistol and ammunition. Not long afterwards, another operative delivered 30 extra kilograms of TNT .
Around this time a pamphlet was circulating in jihadist groups that was a translation from Arabic into Indonesian of an article that first appeared in the al-Qaeda on-line magazine Sawt al-Jihad . Entitled "You Don't Need to Go to Iraq for Jihad", it was written in 2003 by a Saudi jihadist, Muhammad bin Ahmad as-Salim . [8]
Hambali : Riduan Isamuddin, is being held at Guantanamo Bay detention camp , since his August 2002 arrest in Thailand . He is accused of masterminding the 2002 Bali bombings as well as the Marriott blast. According to interrogation reports, Hambali was undergoing plans to develop biological weapons , in particular anthrax . Hambali was al Qaeda's main connection in South East Asia, and was apparently trying to open an "Al Qaeda bio-weapons branch plant" in either Malaysia or Indonesia. He told investigators he had been "working on an Al Qaeda Anthrax program in Kandahar," Afghanistan . [9]
Dr. Azahari Husin , a former university lecturer, was also known as the "Demolition Man" because of his bomb-making skils, and used a mobile phone to detonate the Marriott bomb and included ingredients similar to other Indonesian blasts. According to Indonesian police, "If Azahari did not make the bomb, then its creator was following his manual." [10]
Noordin Mohammed Top was suspected of helping finance the Bali blast and helping build the Marriott bomb. [11] Noordin is a Malaysian citizen. [12]
Muhammad Rais was convicted in May 2004 of violating anti-terrorism laws in connection with the attack. Rais transported the explosives from various towns to Jakarta , where they were used in the bomb. He was sentenced to seven years in prison for his role. [7] ""We saw the Marriott attack as a message from Osama bin Laden,"" Rais said at his trail. [13]
Rusman Gunawan alias "Gun Gun" was sentenced in October 2004 to four years jail for facilitating and aiding terrorism. In particular he was found to have transferred the money (in Australian dollars ) that was ultimately used to finance the Marriott bombing. He and six other Indonesian students were arrested during raids in Pakistan. He trained at the Al Ghuraba training camp in Afghanistan. [14] In 2002 while he attended university in Pakistan, he took over as the "intermediary" for e-mail messages between al-Qaeda and Hambali, who at the time was hiding in Cambodia . [15]
Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep is one of Hambali's key lieutenants. and like Hambali is being held at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp . He allegedly transferred the al Qaeda funds used for the bombing and knew of Jemaah Islamiah plots to launch attacks elsewhere in South East Asia. The CIA claims he was to be a suicide bomber for a "second wave" of al Qaeda attacks targeting Los Angeles. [16]
Gempur Angkoro , alias Jabir, is al-Ghozi's cousin and was one of Top's most trusted men; he, was killed in a raid on 29 April. Jabir personally assembled the Marriott bomb, and the bombs used in the 2004 Jakarta embassy bombing . (Jakarta Post, 2 May) [17]
Sardona Siliwangi , was the first person to be sentenced for the Marriott attack. He had been "legally and convincingly" proven guilty of an act of terrorism, during his trial in the town of Bengkulu on the island of Sumatra , and sentenced to ten years in prison. Siliwangi had stored at his Bengkulu home, six cartons of explosives left by the suicide operative Asmar Latin Sani . The explosives were later moved to the South Sumatra town of Lubuk Linggau before being taken to Jakarta on the island of Java . [18]
Air Setyawan , Luthfi Haidaroh and Urwahr were all arrested in the Central Java city of Surakarta on 26 July 2004 by Indonesia's Detachment 88 anti-terrorist squad, which is trained and equipped by the United States and Australia. [19]
Stuart A. Levey , the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence in the United States, believes that the 2002 Bali bombing, and the Marriott Hotel bombing were financed by smuggling $30,000 in cash for each attack from al-Qaeda to allied terrorists in Asia. By contrast, the 9/11 Commission estimated the 11 September 2001 attacks cost between $400,000 and $500,000 over two years—at least some of which was deposited in foreign accounts and accessed by the plotters in the USA. [20]
The Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney said: [21]
Hambali went to the training camps in Afghanistan that they ran back in the '90s, subsequently received funding from al Qaeda, went back then to Indonesia, and was behind some of the major attacks there. So you've got this sort of home-grown, but nonetheless affiliated, extremist operation going now in Indonesia. You'll find the same thing if you go to Morocco, where they had the attack in Casablanca; in Turkey, Istanbul, and so forth.
It was the simultaneous presence at al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan by militants from across South East Asia that facilitated many of the personal relationships that exist between JI and members of other violent Islamist groups. These include the Moro Islamic Liberation Front , a secessionist movement fighting for a Muslim homeland in the southern Philippines , as well as several other Indonesian, Malaysian and Thai groups. The weight of evidence suggests that although some JI personnel might be inspired by the larger global mystique of figures such as Osama bin Laden, the South East Asian group remains operationally and organisationally distinct. [22]
The main Jakarta stock-market index tumbled 3.1 percent after the attack and its currency, the rupiah , lost as much as 2 percent of its value against the US dollar. [23]
Australia issued a warning for its citizens to avoid all international hotels in Jakarta after intelligence found the capital could be under the threat of further attacks. [1]

J.W. Marriott and Ritz-Carlton properties are site of two explosions. Eight people confirmed dead.
INTERNATIONAL REPORT—Early this morning local time the JW Marriott Hotel and The Ritz-Carlton Jakarta Hotel, both located in Mega Kuningan, South Jakarta, Indonesia, were the sites of two separate explosions resulting in at least nine deaths, according to reports.
Marriott International confirmed the bombings around midnight Eastern time yesterday via Twitter: “At approximately 7:48 a.m. local time, explosions occurred at the J.W. Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Hotels in Jakarta, Indonesia.”
The Ritz-Carlton Jakarta was the site of a terrorist bombing that left at least nine dead and others injured.
A report from The Wall Street Journal indicates that suicide bombers are suspected in the events that killed nine and injured at least 53 people.
The JW Marriott explosion is believed to have occurred in the basement car park, according to police in a BBC story . The Ritz-Carlton bomb went off in a third-floor restaurant. And a third, undetonated bomb in the JW Marriott was found in a 18th-floor guestroom thought to be the bombers' headquarters.
The GM of the Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur in neighboring Malaysia told HotelNewsNow.com that for now he didn’t know any more than what media is reporting.
“I haven't spoken to the (Ritz-Carlton Hotel team) in Jakarta recently so all the information I have got (is) from CNN as they have good coverage and have people on the ground in Indonesia,” said Stephen A. Pcokkinias.
“This is a regrettable incident. ... I don’t want to call (the team in Jakarta) as they must be quite busy, but I did text the hotel GM.”
Pierre-Alain Perusset is the managing director of The Ritz-Carlton Jakarta Hotel . Nagesh Chawla is the hotel manager at the JW Marriott Hotel .
It’s business as usual, Pcokkinias said. “We have no incidents in Malaysia so we are not taking any (precautionary) measures.”
From the JW Marriott Kuala Lumpur: “We have not heard anything from the hotel in Jakarta, but we are keeping ourselves updated with the most recent news through the various reports on Internet and television,” said Mahmoud Skaf, hotel manager. “… We have not had any people calling regarding the incident in Jakarta."

If you are a hotelier in Jakarta and would like to talk about the incidents, please contact Stacey Mieyal Higgins at Stacey@hotelnewsnow.com .
The implications, however, for other hotels in Asia-Pacific are significant. A story from Channel NewsAsia said hotels in Singapore are stepping up security. The country also issued a travel advisory.
In the story, associate professor Kumar Ramakrishna, S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said: “The attacks in Jakarta this morning basically drive home the point that although those two hotels, the Ritz-Carlton and the Marriott, were relatively well-protected... a militant network that’s really determined and resourceful may succeed.”
Reuters posted a photo gallery of the hotel damage and human impact.
The Bali Hotels Association issued a statement in which it said that there appeared to be no imminent threat for the area, although hotels were put on red alert.
Bali is about 1,245 kilometers (about 776 miles) away from Jakarta in Indonesia.
“BHA members have briefed their staff to remain calm and focus on the comfort and safety of their guests, and to avoid speculation and rumour surrounding the incidents,” according to the statement. “BHA are keeping their members informed of developments.
“Following a briefing by the Chief of Police in Bali this morning, he indicated that there is no credible threat in place at the present time for Bali; however all members of the community and tourism industry must remain alert to ensure the safety of visitors to Bali and the community at large.”

Riduan Isamuddin also transliterated as Riduan Isamudin, Riduan Isomuddin, and Riduan Isomudin, better known by the nom de guerre Hambali, born as Encep Nurjaman (born April 4, 1964 [1] ) is the former military leader of the Indonesian terrorist organization Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), which is linked with Al Qaeda . He is now in extrajudicial detention in the United States 's Guantanamo Bay detainment camps , in Cuba . [2]
Hambali was often described as "the Osama bin Laden of Southeast Asia ". Some media reports describe him as Bin Laden's lieutenant for Southeast Asian operations. Other reports describe him as an independent peer. He was highly trusted by Al Qaeda and was the main link between the two organisations. Hambali was a close friend of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , who planned Operation Bojinka and the September 11 Terrorist Attacks . Hambali envisioned creating a Muslim state, in the form of an Islamic superpower (a theocracy ) across Southeast Asia , with himself as its leader ( Caliph ). His ambition was to rule Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , Brunei and parts of the Philippines , Myanmar , and Thailand [3] [4]
He received increasing attention in the aftermath of the 2002 Bali nightclub bombing , in which 202 people died. According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence he served as the third in command of Al Qaeda, from the 2003 capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to his own capture in 2005. [5] He was eventually apprehended in a joint operation by the CIA and Thai police. He is currently imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba, after three years of CIA custody in a secret location.

Riduan Isamuddin was born Encep Nurjaman in the rice belt of Sukamanah , a small village in Cianjur Regency , in the province of West Java , Indonesia . He was the son of a peasant farmer, and was the second of thirteen children. He first became involved with Jemaah Islamiah as a teenager. He was a diligent student at his Islamic high school, Al-Ianah. He travelled to Afghanistan in 1983 to fight the Soviet Union during the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan . During his three years as a mujahid , from 1987 to 1990, he met Osama bin Laden . Friends and family in Indonesia say they did not know of his activities overseas. His nephew Wilson Halim is also said to be a renowned budding youth terrorist in Malaysia.[ citation needed ]
His name has been transliterated into English text in several different ways over the years, including;
His name was spelled Hambali, Riduan bin Isomuddin on the Summary of Evidence memo prepared for his Combatant Status Review. [6]
His name was spelled Ryuduan bin Isomuddin by Scott McClellan during a press briefing. [7] McClellan spelled his name letter by letter.
His name is spelled Riduan Isamuddin in the report of the 9-11 Commission . [8]
His name was spelled Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin by the US Treasury . [9]

(March 2009)
In 1991, Nurjamin returned to Cianjur for one week, before going to Malaysia , where he met the two co-founders of JI, Abdullah Sungkar and Abubakar Bashir . The three lived in a housing compound in Kampung Sungai Manggis, Banting , Selangor . Nurjaman internationalized the terrorist group's activities and took on a new name in his permanent residence permit: Riduan Isamuddin. His nickname, Hambali, is an allusion to Hanbali , an Islamic school of jurisprudence.
The two co-founders sent their students to "study" in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The students actually fought the Soviets until the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan. A woman named Noralwizah Lee Abdullah had gone to Malaysia for religious schooling. She secretly married Isamuddin after meeting him at the Luqmanul Hakiem School in Ulu Tiram , Johor . The school was founded by Sungkar and Bashir.
Initially, Isamuddin struggled to make a living for his family. He switched from selling kebabs to patenting medicines. He soon disappeared from his home for weeks at a time, and he received many visitors at home. He eventually came to own a red hatchback and several cell phones. Investigators say that many calls on those cell phones were made to Mohammed Jamal Khalifa , Osama bin Laden's brother in law, who had arrived back in Manila , Philippines in 1991.
After Arab visitors gave his family lots of money, he founded a shell company , Konsojaya , in June 1994. Ostensibly an import-export company trading in palm oil between Malaysia and Afghanistan , it was essentially a front company for terrorism.[ citation needed ] Wali Khan Amin Shah , who would become the financier of Operation Bojinka , was a director of Konsojaya. The company provided financial assistance to the project until it was discovered by investigators on a laptop computer after an apartment fire on January 6, 1995. Shah was arrested in the Philippines but escaped on a short order. Shah was arrested in Malaysia in December 1995. Both Shah and mastermind Ramzi Yousef , who escaped the Philippines but was arrested in Lahore , Pakistan , were extradited to the United States . They were both convicted and sentenced to life in prison for participating in the project.
Hambali goes underground[ edit ]
Hambali's company attracted attention of investigators so his dealings went quiet for a while.[ citation needed ] He decided to preach, raise money, and recruit for his cause. He went underground in 2000 and started a wave of church-bombings in Indonesia. He always had a "hands-on" technique; he met his foot soldiers and came to them "with detailed plans, plenty of cash and two of his own bombmakers." He always fled before the bombing commenced. Meanwhile, the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah, Abu Bakr Bashir , was preaching jihad at his schools while denying links to Islamic militants.[ citation needed ]
Hambali planned and attended the January 2000 Al Qaeda Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . Among the others present were two September 11 hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi . This gathering in Kuala Lumpur was observed by the CIA and Malaysian authorities, but what specifically was being said at the meetings was not picked up. Hambali also provided money and documents to Zacarias Moussaoui in October of that year.
After the Bali nightclub bombing , in which 202 people were killed, Hambali received more attention from the United States. In the years leading up to the attack, the Indonesian government's action against Islamic militants had been minimal. Following the attack, Abu Bakr Bashir was arrested as part of a crack down on Jemaah Islamiah. He was wanted in Indonesia [10] for the bombings of several churches in the region, and wanted for the Bali bombing and a failed plot on several targets in Singapore.
Hambali used a series of safe-houses throughout Southeast Asia , especially Thailand and Cambodia , to move around. While he was in Ayutthaya , Thailand , 75 kilometers north of Bangkok , he was planning a terrorist attack against several Thai hotels and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit (APEC) in Bangkok on October 2003. Hambali had used a false Spanish passport to enter Thailand while his wife used her Malaysian passport.
Thai police found him as part of a joint operation between the Thai police and the CIA on August 11, 2003. The twenty uniformed and undercover police smashed down the door to his one bedroom apartment in Ayutthaya, and arrested him and 33-year-old Noralwizah Lee Abdullah, a Chinese Malaysian who was considered to be his wife. Hambali was wearing a pair of jeans, a t-shirt, a baseball cap, and a pair of sunglasses. Police also seized explosives and firearms in the property. It marked the end of a 20-month hunt for Hambali, who was 37 years of age when he was captured.
A 2006 Human Rights Watch report stated that Hambali was imprisoned in Jordan for the account of the CIA .[ citation needed ] On September 6, 2006, President George W. Bush confirmed that Hambali had been held by the CIA and revealed that he had been transferred to Guantanamo Bay . [11] His wife is now in Malaysian custody.
On September 8, 2006 Indonesia formally requested access to Hambali to ensure a fair trial . [12] The United States are reluctant to hand him over because of the lenient sentence Indonesia imposed on Bashir.[ citation needed ]
Hambali is also wanted in the Philippines for the transfer of explosives on Filipino soil in an attempt to transport them to Singapore .
Following his capture the USA would not confirm or deny that he was in their custody. But on September 6, 2006, President Bush acknowledged [13] the existence of covert, overseas CIA interrogation centres (colloquially known as black sites ) and announced that 14 high-profile members al Qaeda and related groups had been transported from those sites to Guantanamo Bay. [14] Those 14 include Hambali and an alleged lieutenant of his called Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep alias Lillie or Li-Li.
Combatant Status Review[ edit ]
the protections of the Geneva Conventions did not extend to captured prisoners who are not members of the regular Afghan armed force nor meet the criteria for prisoner of war for voluntary forces. [15]
Critics argued the Conventions obliged the U.S. to conduct competent tribunals to determine the status of prisoners. Subsequently, the U.S. Department of Defense instituted Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs), to determine whether detainees met the new definition of an " enemy combatant ".
"Enemy combatant" was defined by the U.S. Department of Defense as:
an individual who was part of, or supporting, the Taliban, or al-Qaeda forces, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. This includes any person who commits a belligerent act or has directly supported hostilities in aid of enemy armed forces. [16]
The CSRTs are not bound by the rules of evidence that would normally apply in civilian court, and the government’s evidence is presumed to be “genuine and accurate.” [17] From July 2004 through March 2005, CSRTs were convened to determine whether each prisoner had been correctly classified as an "enemy combatant".
Riduan Isamuddin was among the 60% of prisoners who chose to participate in tribunal hearings. [18] A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for the tribunal of each detainee, listing the allegations that supported their detention as an "enemy combatant".
Riduan Isamuddin's memo accused him of the following: [19]
The Department of Defense announced on August 9, 2007 that all fourteen of the "high-value detainees" who had been transferred to Guantanamo from the CIA's black sites , had been officially classified as "enemy combatants". [20] Although judges Peter Brownback and Keith J. Allred had ruled two months earlier that only "illegal enemy combatants" could face military commissions, the Department of Defense waived the qualifier and said that all fourteen men could now face charges before Guantanamo military commissions . [21] [22]
Possible transfer to Washington DC for a civilian trial[ edit ]
According to Xinhua the Obama Presidency is considering transferring Riduan Isamuddin to Washington DC for a civilian trial. [23]
Some of the above information about Hambali, and more, can be read in the report [8] of the 9-11 Commission.

Analysis
Riduan Isamuddin (also known as Hambali) is an Indonesian citizen who was captured in August 2003 in Ayuttaya, a Thai city 50 miles to the north of Bangkok, by a joint force of Thai and US security forces. The US Government accuses Hambali of being the operational commander of Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and a lead member of al-Qaeda responsible for multiple bombings in Southeast Asia, including the Bali bombings of October 2002 which killed over 200 people. He has been classified as a ‘High-Value Detainee’ (HVD), and was held for over three years in secret detention before being transferred to Guantánamo Bay in September 2006, where he remains.
Hambali was captured in a joint Thai-CIA operation in Ayuttaya on 11 August 2003, several hours after his associate, Lillie , was captured in Bangkok. He was initially held in US custody in a secret location in Thailand for 3-4 days, during which time he has testified that he was made to stand in a stress position with his hands cuffed to a hook in the ceiling, and kept naked, blindfolded and with a sack over his head.
Hambali’s continued secret detention in Afghanistan was confirmed in September 2003 by a senior Asian intelligence officer ‘with access to key interrogation records’ . This official stated that he was being held and interrogated at Bagram Airbase, alongside Zubair and Lillie . Hambali has testified that he was kept naked for most of the first six weeks of his detention in Afghanistan. Clothes were provided during the second week, but then removed again. He has also said that he was beaten repeatedly, with his interrogators placing a thick collar around his neck and then slamming him against walls.
The fate and whereabouts of Hambali after the initial six weeks of his detention in Afghanistan is unclear. Indeed, the only fact which has been made public regarding Hambali’s treatment after Afghanistan comes from his testimony to the International Committee of the Red Cross, where he states that in his third place of detention ‘he was threatened with a return to previous methods of ill-treatment (namely, having his head slammed against the wall by use of a collar), by his interrogators showing him the collar during interrogation sessions’.
Some reports have suggested that Hambali was held on the British island territory of Diego Garcia at some point after his capture, with Time magazine running a story in October 2003 which cited a ‘regional intelligence official’ to this effect. Indeed, the Council of Europe’s Rapporteur investigating European complicity in US renditions and secret detention – Dick Marty – claimed in his 2007 final report that ‘we have received concurring confirmations that United States agencies have used the island territory of Diego Garcia... in the “processing” of high-value detainees’. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Novak, also claimed in 2008 that he had ‘received credible evidence from well-placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on Diego Garcia between 2002 and 2003’. However, neither Marty nor Novak named any detainees in particular, and there is little in the way of concrete evidence to suggest that Hambali was among those who may have been detained on the island. In particular, the Time story is based largely on records obtained of Hambali’s interrogations on 22 and 26 August, and it is likely that these were in fact from his detention in Afghanistan.
Hambali has also been cited by the Associated Press’ Adam Goldman as having been detained in Morocco and then Romania during 2004 and 2005, although again there is little in the way of detailed evidence in the public domain to support such assertions. Click here for further analysis of where the HVDs – including Hambali – may have been held during 2005-2006 .
On 4 September 2006, Hambali was transferred along with 13 other HVDs out of the CIA’s secret prison network and into US military detention in Guantánamo Bay. This final transfer was announced by President Bush two days later , as part of a wider disclosure about the CIA’s use of secret prisons.
Hambali remains detained in Guantánamo Bay.

<h1>Bali Bomber Suspect Hambali Seeks Guantanamo Release </h1>
12 March 2010
WASHINGTON - Hambali, the alleged Bali bomb mastermind who is suspected of links to Al-Qaeda, filed a petition Thursday seeking his release from Guantanamo where he has been detained for more than three years.
Considered the operational chief of Southeast Asian militant group Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) until his capture in Thailand in 2003, Hambali, whose real name is Riduan Isamuddin, filed a habeas petition with the US District Court in Washington.
Hambali, accused of plotting the October 2002 attack in Bali that killed 202 people, most of them foreign tourists, was held for three years in secret CIA prisons before being transferred to Guantanamo in September 2006.
In addition to the Bali bombing he is thought to have raised funds from Al-Qaeda, with whom he has denied any links, for the 2003 attack on the Marriott hotel in Jakarta that left 12 people dead.
JI has long been suspected of having ties to Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network, which was behind the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States that killed close to 3,000 people, most in New York.
Hambali allegedly headed JI until late 2002. He was arrested in Thailand in August 2003 and handed over to US authorities, who are currently detaining him at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
The US also accuses Hambali of orchestrating and funding an attack on an Indonesian church on Christmas Eve 2000 that left 18 dead, and of plotting attacks on the embassies of the US, Britain and Australia in Singapore.
In a major setback for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled in June 2008 that detainees being held without charge at Guantanamo enjoy the constitutional right of habeas corpus, which allows them to challenge their detention.

<h1>Alleged Bali bomber Hambali seeks Guantanamo release Considered the operational chief of Southeast Asian militant group Jemaah Islamiyah </h1>
Fri, Mar 12, 2010
AFP
WASHINGTON - Hambali, the alleged Bali bomb mastermind suspected of links to Al-Qaeda, filed a petition Thursday seeking release from Guantanamo where he has been detained without charge for more than three years.
Considered the operational chief of Southeast Asian militant group Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) until his capture in Thailand in 2003, Hambali, whose real name is Riduan Isamuddin, filed a habeas petition with the US District Court in Washington.
Hambali, accused of plotting the October 2002 attack in Bali that killed 202 people, most of them foreign tourists, was held for three years in secret CIA prisons before being transferred to Guantanamo in September 2006.
In addition to the Bali bombing he is thought to have raised funds from Al-Qaeda, with whom he has denied any links, for the 2003 attack on the Marriott hotel in Jakarta that left 12 people dead.
JI has long been suspected of having ties to Osama bin Laden's Al-Qaeda network, which was behind the September 11, 2001 attacks on the United States that killed close to 3,000 people, most in New York.
Hambali allegedly headed JI until late 2002. He was arrested in Thailand in August 2003 and handed over to US authorities, who are currently detaining him at the US naval base in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
The US also accuses Hambali of orchestrating and funding an attack on an Indonesian church on Christmas Eve 2000 that left 18 dead, and of plotting attacks on the embassies of the US, Britain and Australia in Singapore.
For years the US Congress and former president George W. Bush had sought to deny detainees the right to challenge their detention without charge at Guantanamo on the grounds that they are "enemy combatants."
In a major setback for the Bush administration, the Supreme Court ruled in June 2008 that detainees being held at Guantanamo enjoy the constitutional right of habeas corpus, which allows them to challenge their detention.
Some detainees have since been cleared of any wrongdoing and freed, but the vast majority, including Hambali, remain high-risk prisoners awaiting trial.
US President Barack Obama is facing a growing clamour of calls to try key terror suspects still held at Guantanamo in military commissions rather than civilian courts.
Leading Democratic US Senator Jim Webb hit out in January at reported plans to try Hambali, who is sought for trial in his homeland of Indonesia, at a civilian court in the Washington area.
"The Indonesian government, which has already executed three others involved in this bombing, wants to try him. I do not understand the relevance of trying him as a common criminal in the civilian courts of the United States," he said.
Webb's comments came after he and five other US senators joined a growing chorus of calls for US Attorney General Eric Holder to reverse his decision to try Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the accused mastermind of the September 11, 2001 attacks, in civilian court rather than before military commissions.
When Obama signed an executive order to close Guantanamo within a year, it prompted speculation that Hambali - described by Bush as one of the most dangerous men in the world - could be returned to Indonesia to stand trial.
Jakarta has lodged several requests with Washington for access to Hambali.
Obama appears near a compromise to allow military tribunals to move forward for the alleged September 11 plotters in exchange for a deal to close Guantanamo.
The Obama administration is seeking around 237 million US dollars to move Guantanamo prisoners to a maximum-security prison off the Mississippi River in Thomson, Illinois.
More than 180 detainees remain at Guantanamo, many of them already cleared for release if third countries or their countries of origin would be willing to accept them.

<h1>Retirees Propel McCain to the Fundraising Finish Line </h1>
by Massie Ritsch on September 3, 2008
As the Republican nominee prepares to shift to public financing, donors at law firms, investment companies and in real estate join retired individuals as his biggest donors
ST. PAUL — Preparing for a general election in which he cannot collect private donations, John McCain vaulted in front of Barack Obama in fundraising from one of the biggest groups of donors in American politics: the senior set. A new analysis of the Republican nominee’s summer fundraising by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics has found McCain leading Obama among retired donors almost two to one in June and July, $8.1 million to $4.5 million.
While Obama has raised more total money than McCain this summer, McCain has collected more from larger donors in 15 of the 25 biggest-giving industries since it became clear who his Democratic opponent in November would be. Individual donors working in real estate, securities and investment, insurance and the oil and gas industry, as well as doctors and other health professionals, all gave more money to McCain in June and July, as did donors in other industries. Obama led McCain among industries including lawyers, college professors and other educators , entertainment and the computer/Internet industry.
Retirees, though, have given more money to the two major parties’ presidential nominees than any industry this summer – a total of $12.6 million in June and July. (August fundraising reports are not due to the Federal Election Commission until Sept. 20.) In June and July, McCain collected 64 percent of retirees’ contributions disclosed to the FEC. Employees of one Florida retirement community, The Villages, even rank among McCain’s top donors since June.
“After a long period of lackluster fundraising, the McCain campaign seems to have taken advantage of the less cluttered Republican field in recent months and gone to some of the traditional wells of campaign finance,” said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. “John McCain’s strong financial support from seniors recently mirrors polls that show that he’s popular with that demographic.”
As a group, retirees have contributed at least $78.5 million to the presidential race as a whole—all candidates since January 2007—and Democrats have collected slightly more than Republicans since the election cycle began. Contributors listed as “retired” in FEC reports are assumed to be senior citizens, but independently wealthy individuals of all ages may label themselves as retired when making campaign contributions.
McCain soon faces a shift in the financing of his campaign. “The clock is ticking,” Krumholz said. “When Senator McCain accepts the Republican nomination on Thursday night, he must stop raising and spending private money and rely solely on public financing from taxpayers.”
Like Obama, McCain has relied on bundles of money collected from individuals who work together. McCain’s biggest donor in June and July, based on $77,150 in contributions from its employees, was Citadel Investment Group, a Chicago-based hedge fund run by one of his major fundraisers , Kenneth C. Griffin. Employees of a Chicago law firm, Sidley Austin, pitched in $69,200. (Obama, who met his wife at the firm while working there one summer, remains the preferred candidate of donors there , however.)
Other top contributors to McCain this summer include the accounting and consulting giant, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which also operates a lobbying practice in Washington, hotel operator Marriott and Wall Street banks Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. A law firm founded by Charles Keating , who symbolized how political influence contributed to the collapse of savings and loans in the 1980s, bundled at least $50,000 to McCain’s presidential campaign, almost all of it in July. McCain was among a group of senators known as “The Keating Five,” who collected more than $1 million in campaign contributions form Keating and helped him fend off government regulation of his S&L.
On its award-winning website, OpenSecrets.org , the Center’s presidential section analyzes the candidates’ fundraising reports through July. Last week, during the Democrats’ convention in Denver, the Center posted observations on Obama’s summer fundraising .

<h1>Obama's Acceptance Speech Hit Some High Notes, but His </h1>
The Democrats may be promising more than they can deliver.
+ More
Like Joseph P. Kennedy, who did not stay in Los Angeles to see his son deliver his acceptance speech in the Los Angeles Coliseum—the last time a Democratic nominee did so in a stadium (for a good account of that, see this excellent story in USA Today)—I decided to watch the speech on television rather than in the stadium.
Our reasons were different. Ambassador Kennedy (who was the same age in 1960 as John McCain is now) did not want to be spotlighted as the man who had bought the nomination for his son (which he was); I wanted to see how it played on television. Joseph Kennedy flew to New York and invited himself to watch the speech with Henry Luce, the proprietor of the then Republican-leaning Time and Life but who had a soft spot for Catholics (his wife, Clare Boothe Luce, was a Catholic convert), in his River House apartment in New York.
I chose, faute de mieux (as Jean-François Kerry would say), to watch the speech in my room at the Courtyard Marriott Cherry Creek (which is a couple of miles from the Saks/Neiman's shopping center and across the street from a "checks cashed" store).
First, a trivial point. The temple stage set at Invesco Field was obviously a knockoff of the Pergamon Altar in the quite wonderful Pergamon Museum in Berlin, put together by Middle East history academicians (when Germany had the best of them) in the early 20th century. Did Barack Obama have time in his visit to Berlin (when he didn't have time to fly to see the wounded American soldiers in Ramstein) to visit the Pergamon Museum? Just asking. It's something every cultured person should see. (By the way, why wasn't there any reference to individual investment accounts in a speech delivered in a stadium to which Invesco bought naming rights?)
Anyway, during most of the speech, the setting (as seen on NBC, ABC, and the local Fox affiliate; the Courtyard Marriott, to its shame, doesn't have Fox News on its cable menu) didn't seem too off-putting. What looked weird (and to Marc Ambinder in the stadium, too) was the fireworks erupting from each end of the Pergamon temple after Obama spoke. And the drop-off from the podium was off-putting for those of us who are scared of heights.
And Obama? This was not quite his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, when, after all, he wasn't the Democratic presidential nominee. His delivery was not quite flawless, but that didn't matter. He seemed, to some conservative bloggers at least, to be angry, but he read off the teleprompter with great skill. (What if someone had blitzed the teleprompters? Bad thought.)
I thought it was, for most voters, a workmanlike rather than an inspirational speech. He started with the advantage that the mood of the country is negative—a big majority of us think the nation is seriously on the wrong track. He's going with the flow there.
But on the other main themes, of this speech and this Democratic National Convention, I'm not quite so sure he's on steady ground.
A fair part of the speech was devoted to the notion that John McCain is the (90 percent) same as George W. Bush. But that's pretty easy to refute. Temperamentally, on a variety of high-profile issues, McCain has been over many years at odds with Bush, and I don't think Obama's clever tropes are going to affect the public's impressions of this very much.
The second theme of Obama's speech, and that of the subsidiary speakers at the convention, was that middle-class Americans are suffering terribly (despite the revised economic figures that showed gross domestic product in the second quarter increasing not 1.9 percent but 3.3 percent). Obama went into something like a laundry list of how his administration would help everybody out.
Conservative commentators have noticed the tensions between the life stories of how the Obamas and the Bidens have lifted themselves by their own efforts and how people in similar situations now can only hope for advancement with additional government assistance. There's an obvious tension here: The safety net worked in the past, and we need more in the future. But I think there's an additional problem. How credible are the promises that everybody can go to college and get healthcare services without paying anything? Are Obama and the Democrats promising too much?
On energy, we heard some defensiveness. "Drilling is a stopgap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close." The audience in the stadium loved this. But $4 gas has undermined this position hugely. Obama and the Democrats are playing defense here.
My bottom line is that the major themes of Obama's speech and—so far as he controlled it—the Democrats' themes may not be sustainable. McCain = Bush: There are too many instances (not all to conservatives' liking) to the contrary. Economic distress: But would raising taxes on high earners and raising protectionist walls alleviate it? Obama's campaign tried to insert more "granular" descriptions of what an Obama government (and Democratic Congress) would do. But are they credible?
And finally, Obama's attempt to rule out of bounds any suggestions that he is not "patriotic." Why should we ignore his 20-year association with his preacher (and inspiration for the title of his 2005 book), who proclaims, "God damn America!"? Why should we ignore his association with the unrepentant Weather Underground bomber terrorist William Ayers ? Obama and the mainstream media would like to sweep these things aside, but are they not important things about who he is?
It's nice to declare out of bounds any attacks that may hurt you. But why should it be considered fair?

Heading into a lunch break, the Obama and Clinton camps are sparring over what is and isn't a concession in their sparring over Florida delegates. 
The Obama camp says it's making a concession when it agrees to allowing Florida half its delegate votes. That would give Clinton a net gain of 19 delegates, up from the zero delegates she gets under the current rules.
"An extraordinary concession," says Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida, an Obama man.
"A concession? Give me a break," counters Clinton man Harold Ickes in the hallway outside the party meeting.
He argues from the standpoint that Clinton has a net gain of 38 delegates in Florida. "Hillary Clinton loses delegates."
But Clinton doesn't have any Florida delegates now, let alone an edge of 38. Florida was stripped of all of its delegates.
Score it for Obama. Clinton can't lose delegates she doesn't have. 
Barack Obama will end the five-month primary campaign Tuesday night at the site where the Republican National Convention will be held.
He and his wife will hold a rally at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, symbolic staging apparently meant to signal that Obama will take the battle to the Republicans should he be the Democratic nominee.
It's also a signal that he thinks he has the nomination wrapped up, turning his back on the two pirmary states that vote Tuesday, Montana and South Dakota, and focusing instead on Minnesota, a general election battlefield state.
Susie Buell of San Francisco voted for Hillary Clinton in the California primary. Her vote is counted, the delegates for Clinton guaranteed seats when the Democratic National Convention opens in Denver in August.
But she couldn't stay home when she heard the Democrats would debate whether to seat delegates from Florida and Michigan.
"We want every vote in America counted," Buell said, standing outside DC's Marriott Wardman Park hotel with hundreds of fellow protestors.
Amy Rao of Palo Alto likened it to what happened in 2000, when Democrats claim that Florida did not count all the votes for Al Gore and threw the election to George Bush.
"We will not let that happen again," Rao said.
Her California group all wore T shirts declaring, "We spoke loud and clear. Our voices must be heard."
Among other signs:
"Woman Arise. Stop the Bias!"
The Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic National Committee starts its meeting at 930 am EDT.
Hundreds of people - most of them women and virtually all of them Hillary supporters - are protesting outside the hotel where the Democratic Party's Rules and Bylaws Committee will meet to decide the fate of convention delegates from Florida and Michigan.
""We voted. We want out votes counted," said Janet W. Larson, a Democrat from Jacksonville.
She was one of more than 100 Democrats from the Jacksonville area who rode two buses to Washington, arriivng about 1 am after a 12-hour ride. They're waving signs proclaiming, "We spoke loud and clear. Our voices must be heard."
She said she knew that Florida's primary violated party rules because it was too early. But she said Florida voters shouldn't be penalized.
"It's the politicians who did this," she said. "Not the voters."

Barack Obama is seizing on John McCain's assertion that U.S. troops are down to pre-surge levels in Iraq (McCain appears to have been off by about 20,000). The Obama campaign just sent out some of the prepared remarks Obama plans to deliver in Montana tonight.
In those remarks, Obama reacts to McCain's campaign's reaction that making issue of the troop discrepancy is "nitpicking," saying, "I don’t think tens of thousands of American troops amounts to nitpicking."
He also accuses McCain, in inviting Obama to travel to Iraq with him, of a political stunt and an effort to raise campaign dollars.
For good measure Obama also plans to throw in a reference to former White House press secretary Scott McClellan whose new book is critical of Bush. "Just this week, we were reminded by President Bush’s own former spokesman of how it was deception – not straight talk – that misled the American people into war. It’s time to cut through the tough talk so that we can be straight with the American people about a war that’s cost us thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars without making us safer."
Scott McClellan could be a Barack Obama supporter.
The former Bush press secretary, currently peddling his new book, which charges the White House engaged in a "propaganda" campaign to sell the Iraq war, told CBS and ABC that he was "intrigued by Sen. Obama's message."
And, he told CBS' Katie Couric, ""It's a message that is very similar to the one Gov. Bush ran on in 2000, and won on, promising to bring bi-partisanship and honesty and integrity to Washington."
Then there was this dialogue:
Couric: So you could see yourself actually voting for Barack Obama?
McClellan: I just said I haven't made a decision, but I do think, you know, (presumptive GOP nominee) McCain talked about ending the permanent campaign recently, Sen. Obama talks about changing the way Washington works. They better have a specific plan for doing that if they're gonna actually be the president of the United States, because it is difficult to do.
At the White House Friday, press secretary Dana Perino was asked about the possibility of her predecessor voting for the Democrat.
"I really don't care who he votes for," she said.
Supporters of Hillary Clinton are pushing hard the idea that she is the strongest Democrat against John McCain this fall. But it could be a tough argument to make in at least one of the two states in Saturday's spotlight.
The Democratic party's Rules and Bylaws Committee will meet to try to figure out how and whether to seat the Michigan and FLorida delegations. Latest polls show clearly that McCain handily beats Democratic frontrunner Barack Obama in Florida, but the outcome in Michigan is less clear.
Latest polls from Rasmussen and Quinnipiac surveys give McCain a sizeable lead over Obama in Florida, but Clinton beats the Republican.
In Michigan, though, Rasumussen has McCain and Clinton tied, while McCain beats Obama by 1.

Barack Obama's campaign released a letter from his longtime physician deeming him in "excellent health" and saying the on-again, off-again smoker has managed to give up cigarettes since launching his candidacy but was still using Nicorette gum to manage his cravings.
The letter from doctor David Scheiner, who has seen Obama for 21 years, follows Republican John McCain's release of his doctor's report declaring no recurrence of McCain's skin cancer from 2002. Scheiner said Obama's "family history is pertinent for his mother’s death from ovarian cancer and grandfather who died of prostate cancer," but that Obama "is in overall good physical and mental health needed to maintain the resiliency required in the Office of President."
While reporters enjoyed reading about the 71-year-old McCain's freckles on his backside, the best Obama's doctor shared was that the 46-year-old Obama sometimes gets upper respiratory infections and skin rashes.
As of his last full checkup in January 2007, Obama was running regularly, eating a balanced diet and had low or normal cholesterol and PSA levels, blood pressure of 90/60 and an athletic pulse of 60/minute.

Obama Heads To Michigan Next Week
Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.) will make a stop in Michigan next Monday, less than 48 hours after an expected ruling by the Democratic National Committee about the fate of the Wolverine State's delegation to the party convention in August.
Those familiar with Obama's schedule insist the trip is not designed as victory lap in anticipation of a favorable ruling this weekend at the DNC's Rules and Bylaws Committee meeting or an attempt to kick-start the Illinois senator's general election campaign in the state.
Still, the symbolic import of Obama stopping in Michigan soon after what may be the final ruling about the seating of the state's delegates should not be underestimated.
By traveling to the state for the second time in the last month (former Sen. John Edwards announced his endorsement of Obama in Grand Rapids in mid-May), Obama is sending a clear signal about the importance of Michigan in his general election calculus.
The last three Democratic nominees for president have carried Michigan -- Sen. John Kerry (Mass.) won it with 51 percent in 2004 -- but recent polling shows Obama in a dead heat with Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) in the state.
Democrats have privately fretted for months that the ongoing battle over the seating of delegates selected in the Michigan and Florida primaries could endanger their chances of winning the states in the fall.
A quick recap: Florida and Michigan moved their primaries too far forward in the nominating calendar, according to the DNC, which subsequently stripped both states of their delegates. As a result, none of the candidates actively campaigned in either state and Obama went so far as to remove his name from the ballot in Michigan.
Obama's trip last week to Florida -- he spent three days in the Sunshine State -- coupled with his planned visit to Michigan show he is seeking to assure voters in each of the two states that he believes both are essential to his path to the nomination and they he will cede neither one to McCain.
Republicans, on the other hand, are seeking to use the delegate imbroglio in Michigan and Florida to convince voters that Democrats have written them off. Told of Obama's trip next week, Michigan Republican Party Chairman Saul Anuzis said that the Illinois senator had "ignored" the state, adding: "He will have to do more than make the obligatory photo op stop here to explain his position on bashing the domestic auto industry."

SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT:
NOW the story is this: both the media AND McClellan knew the TRUTH all along, but they were not telling us
The ENTIRE problem was Bush was lying the whole time.
1) McClellan never "went along" with it for his own self-interest -
2) The New York Times never "went along" with the story by printing some stupid story about aluminum tubes
3) The press knew the truth all along, but somehow the administration was such a good liar that the press was helpless
4) The democrats "went along" with the war when it was in their own self-interest in the 2002 and 2004 elections
5) The democrats "went along" with the war by FUNDING it for years and years because a few people in the Bush administration were such good liars.
Is that their story now???
My comment is this: all these people let down the American public - they are all no good and rotten.
For the democrats now to say - oh it was all because Bush was a liar - that is a deception and a lie.
THE REASON BUSH WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH IT IS BECAUSE ALL THOSE PEOPLE KNEW BETTER - SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER - AND WENT ALONG WITH IT FOR THEIR OWN SELF-INTEREST - THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SOLD OUT AMERICA.
YES THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SOLD OUT THIS COUNTRY.
IN LIFE, THE SELL-OUTS ARE THE ONES WHO TIP THE BALANCE.

I am a Democratic voter of over 20 years. I agree with the other poster. IF they do not count all votes in full by both FL and MI, I will dump the Democratic Party and vote for Independents. Obama is an OBAMINATION that has PUPOSELY thwarted democracy by stampeding ON voters rights in these states. OBAMA DISGUSTS ME. I am not concerned about Obama becoming President because this country will not elect a racist black man. Whites will vote just as racist as blacks do and there are far more whites than blacks. Bradley effect any one? What concerns me is the fools in the DNC, that would in concert with NObama, make the mistake of trampling on 2 million Democratic voters and think that this sits well with Democrats. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?
Hillary Clinton run Independent. You will win.

Again... I am missing something.
Florida was controlled by the GOP and as usual... they determined when the general election was.
OBAMA AND CLINTON had a level playing field.
Both on the ballot.. BOTH could do no campaigning in that state. Popular and delegate vote should stand. And guess what..HUSSEIN could not BUY the votes by out spending Clinton.
MICHIGAN... that is a tough one.. Democrats controlled that state.
Both candidates WERE on the ballot. HUSSEIN took his name OFF the ballot??? Why we will never know.
Popular votes stands based on the votes for CLINTON... and good old 'crooked lawyer' Hussein gets the others.
NOTE that HUSSEIN is taking a low profile approach to the rest of the campaign. The less he says, the less likely hood that he will REVEAL the true Obama.
Keep VIPER WRIGHT, MICHELLE OBAMA and HUSSEIN off TV and he can coast.
Note two things in the news..
The new book about GOD BUSH's Administration.
Now McCain is constantly in the news..
MAIN STREAM MEDIA... is ATTACKING both of these guys... and letting their 'golden boy' hide in the wings.
Who says that KING OBAMA does not have a bunch of angels/despots looking over his shoulder... aiding him in his campaign.

If Barack Hussein Obama does not DEMAND that the Democratic National Committee seat ALL Florida delegates WITH FULL VOTES REPRESENTING THE RESULTS of the Florida Primary, then I will consider the Democratic Party FALSE to the IDEALS of the makers of America and will do EVERYTHING in my power to defeat Barack Hussein Obama and EVERY Democratic Party candidate from now until the Democratic Party is abolished and replaced by a political party with ideals akin to the ideals of true Americans. Please note that I have been a Democrat for forty years though I have ALWAYS voted according to my convictions.

I am a 49 year old woman who supported Hillary, until she start all the craziness. I knew Bill was a liar (remember Monica and the impeachment?), but I thought Hillary was stable. She's crazier than Bill. If she destroys this election for Barack, what makes her think that those who support him will forget and support her the next time. We like a team player not a destroyer...I'm sad to be a woman witnessing these women play the victim role. I'm a single parent, from rural Arkansas (yes, they were my governor and 1st Lady). I pulled myself from poverty through education, the military, hard work and prayer. I will not be defined by the likes of Hillary Rodham Clinton and no other self respecting woman should.

"DEMONIZING HILLARY: Every woman in this country should be outraged by the treatment Hillary Clinton has received as a presidential candidate. She is a victim of sexism, discrimination and media onslaught in proportions this country has never seen before. Male dominated media including some veteran journalists have lost all sense of fairness and balance when covering Hillary. They caricature her unfairly, quote her out of context, magnify her shortcomings, want her drop out of the race halfway through the race, belittle her lifelong service to this country, and ignore her service on behalf of children."
Yet, despite all these barriers to her getting the Democratic nomination, the general election would be smooth sailing because she is clearly the superior candidate, becuas eobviously sexism will be less of a problem in the general election than it will be in the Democratic primary.
More stellar Clinton logic for you...

I think all these are because of her gender. This makes one wonder how these seasoned politicians and payed spin doctors of the silver screen treat women in their own lives. Even some of the Democratic Party leaders who cried foul in 2000 with the Florida election fiasco are so eager to suppress millions of votes of Florida and Michigan to deny Hillary the nomination and to fix the election. That is hypocrisy. We should never allow this to happen in this country.

MICHIGAN,
Obama ran up to Michigan WITH LAWYERS IN TOW, when your state legilators were meeting to hold a new Primary. Obama wanted it STOPPED! He also NEVER had to take his name off your ballot! IT WAS AN OPTION! And inexperience! And a Primary!
HE does NOT want a new vote in Michigan!
He just wants to USE YOU NOW so he can get your vote in November!
DO NOT BUY INTO THIS!
He was not qualified during your Primary and he is NOT qualified now!
And what kind of a "Democrat" DOES NOT want to count every vote?
NOOBAMA!Not now and NOT in November!

"Beside the legal arguments, the political ones are important."
At least you're giving up on the legal arguments, realizing you have none...
I agree, there are political implications, which is exactly why Obama has shown willingness to compromise on the seating, and exactly why they will be seated, just not the way Clinton and her protesters will be militantly insisting.

"The Rules Committe should declare the original rule favoring Nevada and South Carolina over Michigan and Florida to be in violation of Voters' Rights of Equal Protection. The Rules Committee should further vote to state that the national party is bound to respect the Equal Protection of Voters in the primary election calendar no matter in which state they reside."
And national primary, here we come! Giving us a process that would put all power in the hands of the big states and urban areas, which is where candidates would focus their campaigns, as opposed to this election cycle where all 50 states got up close and personal views of the candidates and the candidates responded directly to their views for at least a 1 week period.
Your argument fails on several grounds. First, it presupposes going first is better (this campaign season has shown pretty clearly it is not); second, it disregards the well established traditions of the primary process; and third, it fatally misunderstands the equal protection clause, which again applies within a state, not between the states. There are numerous occasions both constitutionally and within federal law where citizens of different states are subject to unequal treatment (In the Electoral College, for instance, California gets 54 EVs for 36.5 million people, while Wyoming gets 3 for 515,000; so the votes of a citizen of Wyoming in the presidential race are worth 6 times as much as a Californian!), the 14th Amendment and the voting rights act guarantee the states must treat all of their people equally and the federal government, when viewing people as a whole, must treat them equally, but when things are subject to federalism, things are different. The parties had the authority to set that rule, and nobody's rights were violated in the process. If you don't like it, run for a seat on the DNC.

I've noticed this meme arising as well. At the very least, it flies in the face of Clinton's repeated promises to fully support the Democratic nominee. I suspect that such support will be paired with the "I told you so" strategy in order to position for 2012.
It's a shame. This is no doubt a difficult time for Clinton--but she can use it to turn away from such strategies, and devote this energy to even more strongly advocating for crucial Democratic issues in the soon-to-arrive general election. A difficult choice for her at this time--but the right one. One such issue, hot off the press, and a crucial Democratic wedge issue that will also cut against McCain's "service support" arguments:

I feel a 50/50 split is the only fair way in Florida. Since Obama's name was not on the ballot, many might have voted for Hillary that would have voted for Obama. We have no way of knowing.
Hillary voted the the DNC penalty and now wants that vote disregarded. So to make it fair, 50% of her votes in Michigan should be ignored and given to Obama. How can you vote one way and when you find it did not work the way you planned, vote another way? People have gotten to know and like Obama after seeing and hearing him. By not campaigning in Florida and Michigan, his message did not get heard. Split the votes 50/50 in Michigan and 60/40 in Florida where his name did appear. Any other decision would be unfair to Obama but this is fair to Clinton since his name wqas on the ballot in Florida. Either way, Obama still has the lead. The DNC needs to revamp the way it works in order to avoid a repeat down the road.
Michigan and Florida need to appeal to the DNC after the election in order to get their thoughts on the record. The rules they set for this election were alreeady voted on. Then the DNC needs to work out a plan like the Republicans have. Maybe we should all just vote Republican to get our point across.

wORTH REPOSTING..
Michigan in the house-
First of all, the lack of knowledge that most of you have concerning our state would be quite hilarious if it wasn't such a sad state of misinformation and idiocy. Please, come for a visit and really find out who we are - we could use the tourism - ha ha.
Now on to the question raised by 'bsimon'. Yes, most of Michigan is quite disgruntled with Dem. Gov. Granholm and, in turn, with the democrats. But we are also an educated, northern state with strong ties to the unions so, for the most part, the state is still a liberal state. As for whether the current Dems in our state govt. (who are the real ones to blame for this primary fiasco - not Obama) get re-elected....well, that is probably where the backlash will strike. Not in the general election.
As for those of you saying that Obama rejected a revote. Are you nuts? It was no revote - it was a setup by the Clinton party. You do realize that we have open primaries, right? And that means we can choose our ballot on the day of election without ever having to join a party or declare a party (a lovely idea). Well, since our incompetent state government (led by fierce Clinton supporters) screwed our primary and we were told our votes didn't count, how do you think that affected the results? Many people did not go to the polls, others crossed over and voted on the republican ticket - where their votes would count, and a full 40% of the Dem. vote count was uncommitted. That means thousands of people took time out of their day to come to the polls to vote 'anyone but Hillary' in an election that didn't count.
Now, fast forward to the revote suggested by Hillary. She wants a revote but only those who voted on the democratic ticket the first time! What? My dear friends, that is disenfranchisement! First we are told our votes don't count, then we are told that if we voted on the democratic ticket only, we can vote again. Don't you see how unfair this is? What it means is that all of the people who voted for Hillary the first time are welcome to come back to the polls and vote for her again. Everyone else who may have stayed home, crossed over or just went fishing that day are not allowed to participate. What???
Obama's denouncing that revote plan was the just decision for the electorate of Michigan. Everyone should be allowed to come to the polls and revote because that would be the only fair election. What is Hillary afraid of to have the entire state vote? Sounds to me like she is the one who is opposing a fair revote - not Obama.
So I end my long tirade by saying, "Please stop spouting such inane misinformation and threats." We here in Michigan can take care of ourselves. In fact, have you heard a large uproar from Michigan complaining of disenfranchisement? I haven't. So drop it and move on. We have.

But the US Congress also consists of two legislative bodies similar to the British form of parliamentary democracy, though correspondingly, the functions and powers of these two different form of legislative chambers may differ. I was only trying to emphasise that, unlike in a dictatorship or other form of authoritarian rule, in our system of democracy it is not uncommon for a candidate to woo the votes of people belonging to different ethnic groups. One must not read too much into it.
In your myopic view, anyone who speaks the inevitable truth has to be a member of the Obama campaign! I am no one's campaign mouthpiece. I was an ardent admirer of President Bill Clinton and I still am. Compare to the idiot that we have now in the White House, Bill is one of the best presidents we have had in recent history. Does that make me a person from the Clinton campaign? Get a grip of yourself man (or is it woman!) Goodness gracious me, who are you?
You also engage shamlessly in character assassination by claiming that Obama was
pretending to be a Law Professor. Can you quote one instance where he claimed that he was a Law Professor? He certainly was a senior Law Lecturer teaching constitutional law in the University of Chicago Law School. So, my friend, which part of that resume is whacky?
You were again wrong in saying that it was a fantasy of mine to assert that he helped hispanics find jobs. His service as community organizer was not restricted to the African Americans. He was a community organizer in some of Chicago's poorest communites that included the Hispanic community as well.
So don't try to give your two cents worth of cynicism with a heart filled with hate and prejudice. Be objective, fair and truthful in your comment.

I understand your potential objections - that somehow a primary vote cast in January is the same as one counted in June.
Well, we all know that is not true.
I understand that it may take one a minute to see that the national party should not be favoring Voters in one state over Voters in another state - however that is the demands of Equal Protection.
Perhaps some lottery system for the primary calendar would meet the demands of Equal Protection.
Perhaps a system of rotation among the states would meet the demands of Equal Protection.
A haphazard plan which evolved over decades perhaps might be subjected to Equal Protection scrutiny.
However, a national plan of a national party which deliberately seeks to favor the Voters of Nevada over the Voters of Michigan and Florida - that is subject to Equal Protection scrutiny.

It may appear curious to advocate that the Rules Committee declare the original rule UNCONSTITUTIONAL, thereby accepting a constitutional limitation upon itself however it is wise.
It is wise because we are all Americans who should uphold the Constitution and its principles without having a settled court case in front of us.
It is wise because it is the smart thing to do politically right now.
It is also wise to place the 2012 discussion on the right footing - all citizens in the United States are on equal footing.
We can not allow a situation to develop in which a bunch of Washington insiders sit in some obscure party committee meeting and decide which states' Voters have more influence on the process of selecting a President.
Or in this case, have a bunch of fat cats influenced by Harry Reid seek to place the political consultants of Nevada on the inside track to White House appointments, and the Voters of every other state could go jump in Lake Michigan.
As Americans, we follow Constitutional priniciples because we believe in them, not because we have a court saying we have to - the party is not really seeking to avoid a legal battle, but a floor fight which is worse.
The Rules Committee should recognize that Constitutional principles do play a role in the primary process and vote to bind the national party as such.
The Rules Committee perhaps never voted a restriction on itself - or the equivalent of a Marbury decision - however such a decision is appropriate and is the easiest way to solve this dispute which is clearly way out of control.

Comments by people like lylepink get my blood pressure up! Hillary made the worst major political gaffe of this campaign season. You need only to watch the video of her comments and demeanor to see that she was staying in the presidential race expecting something bad to happen to Obama. I mean come on, "My husband didn't win the nomination till June...and RFK was assassinated in June" are pretty self-explanatory.
For those who defend Hillary's "dark" state-of-mind shows a lack respect and humility.

I don't think it has sunk in yet, to the
DNC, the super delegates, and the media, that when the primary is "given" to the amateur Barak Hussien Obama, that the real power of the Democratic Party will emerge. Not just women, not just Hispanics, not just blue collar voters, (all of whom are being portrayed as second class citizens by the press and the talking heads), but every person who stands
for fairness, for excellence, for the BEST
person for the job of president(Hillary), will go the polls in Nov. and vote for John McCain.
I confess I will have to grit my teeth when I do it but I can assuage my crossing over by voting for all other Democratic candidates on the ballot. The Congress will
be solidly Democratic and McCain will not be able to pass anything that the Dems don't want passed. I'd rather see McCain in the White House, he is after all an American War Hero, than the "converted" Muslin(by his own words) and someone who has never served his country, except in the graft ridden politics of Chicago to aid him in his quest for power.(Gosh, the American Dream.) When Obama said Wright "converted" him into the Church of Christ I finally understood just where he was coming from. People who are "converted "are going from one religion to another, not to just join a Church, and the Muslim part that the media is so incensed about begins to make sense.
Hillary is the person who would put this country back on a path of prosperity, respect among ourselves and other countries. Its time the DNC, who for too long have wielded the power over the convention and the outcome of the election ,know that- we the people -are a force to reckon with and to be taken seriously, not as a joke among the pols and media, who seem to think the voting public is a silly little nuisance to be given lip service ,but in the end brushed off as no more than a minor irritation. We have a duty to select the person best able to represent all the American people, not to cave in to the media types who have led the parade to Obamania and who want to
tell us who the next President of USA should be.

The AP first reported {FALSELY} on the "Assination" of Bobby Kennedy in 1968, as somehow Hillary was staying in the nominating process expecting this to happen to Obama, then The Obama campaign was calling every News Orgination to continue the story, led by Mr. Axlerod and other supporters. This was done, and to their delight, it continues despite Bobby Jr.s statement about the incident and the family appreciating the concern Hillary has for Ted and the entire Kennedy family as most Americans have expressed. This is about as low as anything can get from his campaign.

The truth is that the democrats in Washington abandoned over the people of Michigan by voting for the Free Trade Deals.
The democrats in Washington took all sorts of campaign money from lobbyists and other interests pushing the Free Trade Deals.
Bill Clinton even last year was arranging lobbying contracts for his friends in Columbia, South America, even with his wife's campaign underway.
So, when it comes to Michigan - the Washington democrats who left the workers of Michigan high and dry do not want Michigan to have an influencial voice in the nomination process for President of the United States.
The Voters in Michigan might vote for someone who is against the Free Trade Deals or someone who wants to overturn the Free Trade Deals.
You see, Michigan the Washington insiders did this to you and they are now afraid that Michigan Voters will react - the democrats in Wasington don't want to hear from you again.
That is how they operate - the Washington insiders will do you in, and when you attempt to negotiate a proper deal, they will run from you.

Im sure you are a good guy, however we do not have a parliamentary democracy.
Also, please check out the news reports today. Obama was in New Mexico attempting to gain support among hispanics.
Lastly, your assertions about Obama in the hispanic neighborhoods of Chicago is completely wrong - I really do not want to say that you are intentionally creating a deception. However Obama never worked in the hispanic neighborhoods - he worked in the black community and the projects - and ended up in a Black Liberation Theology church.
If you are from the Obama campaign, which I still suspect, your efforts to falsify Obama's resume are not a good idea.

Michigan in the house-
First of all, the lack of knowledge that most of you have concerning our state would be quite hilarious if it wasn't such a sad state of misinformation and idiocy. Please, come for a visit and really find out who we are - we could use the tourism - ha ha.
Now on to the question raised by 'bsimon'. Yes, most of Michigan is quite disgruntled with Dem. Gov. Granholm and, in turn, with the democrats. But we are also an educated, northern state with strong ties to the unions so, for the most part, the state is still a liberal state. As for whether the current Dems in our state govt. (who are the real ones to blame for this primary fiasco - not Obama) get re-elected....well, that is probably where the backlash will strike. Not in the general election.
As for those of you saying that Obama rejected a revote. Are you nuts? It was no revote - it was a setup by the Clinton party. You do realize that we have open primaries, right? And that means we can choose our ballot on the day of election without ever having to join a party or declare a party (a lovely idea). Well, since our incompetent state government (led by fierce Clinton supporters) screwed our primary and we were told our votes didn't count, how do you think that affected the results? Many people did not go to the polls, others crossed over and voted on the republican ticket - where their votes would count, and a full 40% of the Dem. vote count was uncommitted. That means thousands of people took time out of their day to come to the polls to vote 'anyone but Hillary' in an election that didn't count.
Now, fast forward to the revote suggested by Hillary. She wants a revote but only those who voted on the democratic ticket the first time! What? My dear friends, that is disenfranchisement! First we are told our votes don't count, then we are told that if we voted on the democratic ticket only, we can vote again. Don't you see how unfair this is? What it means is that all of the people who voted for Hillary the first time are welcome to come back to the polls and vote for her again. Everyone else who may have stayed home, crossed over or just went fishing that day are not allowed to participate. What???
Obama's denouncing that revote plan was the just decision for the electorate of Michigan. Everyone should be allowed to come to the polls and revote because that would be the only fair election. What is Hillary afraid of to have the entire state vote? Sounds to me like she is the one who is opposing a fair revote - not Obama.
So I end my long tirade by saying, "Please stop spouting such inane misinformation and threats." We here in Michigan can take care of ourselves. In fact, have you heard a large uproar from Michigan complaining of disenfranchisement? I haven't. So drop it and move on. We have.

Hello Sanchez (if that is your real name!), if everyone who stand by the truth and on the side of sanity and decency are

By the way, Santiago is my real surname. JI are the initials of my Christian and middle names. I am a Roman Catholic and I am proud of my heritage. So, Sanchez, be assured. I'm not some cowardly creature hiding in a pseudonym.
Your claim that this week the so-called Obamaniacs are attempting to appeal to hispanic voters is so preposterous. In so saying you are trying to infer that someone else has the sole right and claim to Hispanic voters.
May I remind you that in a parliamentary democracy, it is the inalienable right of every candidate to woo the voters of every race, color or creed, as long as they are Americans. Period! I don't see how only McCain or Hillary can claim sole right to Hispanic voters.
For your information, Obama spent much of his time in voluntary service on the south side of Chicago helping jobless and homeless Hispanics find jobs and shelters.
But he is not making that as a case for his right of claim for the Hispanic voters.
People vote for a candidate based on what he or she stands for and how best he or she serve them and their country. No voter of any particular ethnicity is the sole property of any one candidate. That, my friend, is the reality. Get it!

Obviously there is no specific case or there would be no discussion, right?
If you look up the cases, the courts have ruled that the national parties ARE not entirely private entities, they are subject to some CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES such as the protection of VOTING RIGHTS based on religion and race.
The position is that those CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES extend to EQUAL PROTECTION thus the national parties are bound respect the EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE VOTERS IN THE PRIMARIES.
I have heard your counterargument from others, that is one vote is one vote no matter when it is counted.
However, again, the very existence of the dispute proves that there is a material difference.
If there was no difference, and your position was correct, there would be no dispute and we would not even be talking about the subject.
So there is a material difference, there is a massive dispute, people are fighting over something that you claim is nothing.
So the existence of the fight disproves the point.

Actually, the Michigan Democratic Party has decided to MAKE UP THEIR OWN ELECTION RESULTS.
If those "make-up" numbers reflected actual polling, then maybe those numbers could have some justification rooted in the desire of the Voters.

The series of postings from last week did include a discussion of precedents.
The courts have ruled that the national parties have a "right to exclude" based on opinions, such as issue differences.
However, the courts have also ruled that the national parties' "right to exclude" in the primaries does not extend to Constitutional protections such as race and religion.
As such, the national parties' "right to exclude" does not extend to the protect of Voting Rights and Equal Protection.
Hence, the original rule selecting Nevada and South Carolina over Michigan and Florida is unconstitutional.

Obama IS ATTEMPTING TO STEAL THE ELECTION
LET US BE CLEAR.
First, he played this game by pretending to be the post-racial candidate and then he turned around and pushed race in South Carolina like no other Presidential candidate in recent memory.
Obama is attempting to STEAL THE ELECTION by pretending to be "offended" by comments by Bill Clinton, and then again by Gerry Ferraro - and others.
Obama was never offended by any of these comments - these are false charges.
Third, Obama is attempting to STEAL THIS ELECTION by playing the race card with the Superdelegates - again this is out of bounds and serves to divide this nation even more.
Obama is actually sacrificing the work of many people - white and black in recent decades - in order to run this kind of campaign.
It is a joke that Obama would try this.
Perhaps if Obama actually had a history of slavery and Jim Crow in his family, he would be more in touch with these issue.
However Obama does not have that family history, he is from an immigrant family who is basically carpetbagging on the Black Liberation Theology radical section of the Black community.

Don't the schools teach history anymore? Prior to the 20th century, virtually all nominees were selected by state caucuses, whose delegates consisted of state legislators--there were no elections where people voted directly for a candidate. The final candidate was selected at the party's national convention. This whole system was the direct result of a lack of safe and swift transportation.
By the latter part of the 19th century, the railroads allowed people to traverse the country in relative safety, and much more quickly than by horse. The telegraph also allowed news to go from point A to point B in an instant, rather than at 25 miles per hour. Slowly, the caucus system gave way to direct elections, but the final candidate selection was *still* done at the convention, itself. It wasn't until the 1960s that we started seeing the caucuses disappear and be replaced with primary elections.
The Constitution doesn't have a goddam thing to do with how either party selects candidates, so quit distorting the facts.

Let's have one thing clear - Obama is NOT trying to steal the election. He is LEADING. If anything, Clinton is looking for a way to steal the nomination. It shows how desperate Clinton supporters are getting that they feel that it's Obama trying to steal an election that they think was Hillary's by right! Obama has run a good campaign and ignored the constant Clinton attacks, picked up grass roots support and money from small donors, and put a message forward to the voters, who have given him the clear delegate lead, as well as the popular vote if you count ALL THE VOTES, INCLUDING CAUCUSES. I know that Clinton supporters are reality-averse, but it takes an incredible disconnect from both reality and common sense to suggest that Obama is trying to steal the nomination. You should blame those VOTERS who didn't go and do what you kept telling them to and voted for Barack Obama. It's the VOTERS who are stealing the nomination from Hillary!

The states control the primary elections. Public funds are used, therefore Constitutional Protections must apply.
You can say the national parties are wholly private entities, however that is not entirely true.
If the national democratic party wanted to run its own primary and pay for it, so be it, however the national party insisted on other people paying for the primary.
That kicked in certain Constitutional provisions, like Equal Protection.
I tend to doubt the national parties, given their integral role in the election of the President, are wholly private entities in any event. They are performing a Constitutional function in a Constitutional Process. Equal Protection applies.
Please check out previous postings.

I guess you quit the discussion before because you got pounded.
Beside the legal arguments, the political ones are important.
Specifically, Obama is better off supporting the seating of the entire delegates of Michigan and Florida.
Obama is better off on two counts.
One, he takes the issue from Hillary, and cuts off an avenue for her to go to the Convention, which is the worse case scenario for Obama. Second, Obama can begin to save himself from his stupid move of seeking to prevent the revote in Michigan.
Michigan is important for Obama.
So CLEARLY the endorsement of the superdelegates Obama has received over the past few weeks may have given him a cushion enough - Obama made a massive mistake seeking to stop the re-votes and he can only hope to save himself.

Did anybody get to see that lady screaming for Hillary in Florida?
She took the podium next to Hillary and tried to initiate a Chant.
Problem was... She was saying, "Count Ow-Vah Votes!"
I think that threw the Clintonistas off a bit.
It would have been much more effective if she had just said, "Count Our Votes!"
But she didn't.

"Ha. I get it. Obama is like Will Smith because he is African American too."
Nah, he couldn't have meant that, could he?? After all, it's the Obama campaign that's been running on racism, sexism, and negative campaigning. He's getting a boost because he's black, while Clinton is a victim of her gender, right? I mean, isn't that's what all the exit polls are telling us? I mean, if we can't trust brilliant folks like Geraldine Ferraro and Lanny Davis, my whole belief system just might fall apart!

Several points:
1. The machinations of primary races are not delineated in the Constitution. The political parties determine their nomination processes. While the DNC might have made a mistake in punishing FL and MI too harshly (I think they did), they certainly had the "right" to do so.
2. Michigan is currently polling FOR Obama. Real clear politics has very convincing evidence.
3. Clinton's supporters would be crazy to vote for McCain IF they actually support the Senator's positions. McCain is very far from HRC almost across the board. McCain is anti-choice, anti-health, pro-rich, and now supports aggressive xenophobic immigration policies.
Please don't choose to ruin this country by supporting McCain because Mark Penn had a goofy political strategy and lost the race for HRC.
You are not punishing me, but punishing future generations.

NEver mind that, of all the issues where Clinton and Obama differ, it's Hillary taking the socialist position on healthcare. Don't let facts get in your way. Anyhow, by next week it'll all be moot anyways; the delegates will be seated, Obama will be the nominee, and America will be far better off.

In addition, Obama probably stands in a better position with the Superdelegates if he supports the seating of the entire delegations from Michigan and Florida.
Why?
Because Hillary's people are going to be on the phone with the Superdelegates telling them that Hillary deserves those delegates anyway. It is FAR BETTER for Obama to remove the entire debate from the discussion.
Obama then has a convincing argument to tell the Superdelegates to endorse him and end the fight.
The alternative is to give Hillary a basis for bringing her case to the Convention - which is a worse case scenario for Obama. Obama has hurt himself enough by playing politics with this issue - it is a subject he never should have engaged in, and he should have supported the re-votes.
He would probably be the nominee right now with re-votes.

We have seen our candidate get trashed by the media. We have seen blacks vote like racists and Obama camp falsely accuse Clintons of racism and assassination. The Clintons, who have always fought for civil rights for all types of people. We have seen Obama attempt to disenfranchise two states of voters. We have seen the first ever female Presidential candidate get gender bashing by the male media pundits. We have seen the DNC leaders attempt to push the Clintons out.

Because it would end the issue for Hillary - there would be no rational for a Convention fight beyond the end of June.
Obama would be wise to support the seating of the ENTIRE delegates.
Obama would actually by that act save himself in Michigan - not a bad deal for a candidate who could lose Michigan in the fall election.
This whole thing has become bizarre.
Obama has already performed the amazing feat of stabbing HIMSELF in the back by being unable to resist opposing the re-votes in Michigan and Florida - this was not a smart move and offended Michigan voters which he needs in November.
I actually question Obama's intelligence over that move.
To be honest, I can not believe how bad the mistakes of the Obama campaign have been this year - they have actually taken a lead in spite of themselves.

I don't understand how anyone can blame Obama for the current malaise caused by the debacle in Florida and Michigan.
It was not Obama who pushed the primaries in both the states forward in defiance of the party rules. It wasn't Obama who ruled that the results of those primaries won't count. It was the DNC who made those decision to punish the defiance of the two rouge states. All presidential candidates, including Senator Hillary Clinton accepted the DNC rule and pledged to abide by it.
Now her recalcitrant behaviour smacks nothing more than selfish indulgence! Why? She desperately needs the invalid votes of the two states to make up her deficiency in the delegate as well as popular vote count.
Now, Hillary in her twisted mind comes out with another outrageous demand: Obama's caucus victories should not count!! So wicked and vicious is this deranged woman, that if she doesn't get the nomination she will leave no stone unturned to make sure Obama doesn't win the election.
But, you know what; little does she realise that she is treading a path not only to self-destruction but also to obliviousness of the Clinton legacy, which, by the way, isn't as bad as some might make out to be, barring Hillary's pugnacius, racist polarising campaign!!

The fact that the Obama campaign acted to prevent the re-votes in Michigan and Florida is a violation of DNC rules - the Obama campaign acted to prevent those two states from complying with the rules.
There must be a penalty assessed against the Obama campaign for playing politics with democracy.
The Voters are the ones who did not break the rules - apparently you are comfortable leaving the Voters out of the process which is an integral part of electing the President.
If the DNC was so intent on a different date, it should have paid for its own re-votes and made sure they happened.
At this point, we are left with only one vote and the Voters of those two states have to count someway.

Curious Constitutional Argument which the Obama people are attempting to defend
The national parties are essentially private entities which are free to:
1) Dictate to the States when and how to hold their elections
2) Remember other state offices are usually on the primary ballots - so the expenditure of funds for primaries usually is for an entire list of offices
3) The national parties, as private entities, can somehow intimidate Presidential candidates from exercising free speech rights to certain states which comply with the rules of the private entity.
4) This is why pledges are required.
5) The officials of states which were selected by the national party to go first somehow contributed to this intimidation by stating that if the Presidential candidates did not go along with the plans, there would be some penalty or retaliation in the states that were selected.
Curious how democracy is to be run now.

"Why is it such a bad thing to give a vote only to those people who are willing to actively participate by sacrificing an hour or two of their time to debate the merits of the candidates with their neighbors?"
The major problem with this is that it is not how the general election works. Yeah, the more informed and motivated people will probably pick the best president, but might not pick the one who is the most electable.
That's the argument that Clinton is making. While it is definitely self-serving and disingenuous, that doesn't mean its wrong and I definitely don't think the rules should be changed. Clinton should probably be calling for revotes in them if she truly wanted all50 states to count in her absurd popular vote scenario.
That being said, if the Democrats did away with caucuses, I wouldn't complain.

Hey 37th & O:
Fellow Hoyas know the address... but thankfully some of us are smarter than you are.
You want someone to blame? Blame the state parties for disenfranchising the voters of their states by breaking very concrete, published, widespread rules. They chose to ignore them. Now they pay the consequences.
I understand that being a hardcore Clinton supporter (as you obviously seem to be), it's a difficult pill to swallow when your candidate doesn't win the nomination. I get it... but look at Clinton's remarks last fall where she said that Michigan and Florida don't count. They broke the rules. Their delegates won't be seated. All of a sudden, she needs the numbers to work in her favor and she's done a 180 on her position. Not uncommon.
If you're looking for someone to blame about the Clinton sinking ship, blame the Clintons; if you're looking for someone to blame about Michigan and Florida, blame local officials for their inability (or refusal) to understand the clear rules. If you're looking for someone to yell at, try the mirror. I'm guessing that's the only person that would care to listen.

What a mess. Obama had NOTHING to do with Michigan being stripped of its delegates. He played by the rules and refused to campaign there. Now suddenly it's his responsibility and his burden to assuage the feelings of disgruntled MI voters who voted for Hillary?
Where are the DNC leaders? They should be on the front lines, accepting responsibility for this mess and vowing to make amends, not Obama. It wasn't his fault.
And for the record, the following is what Hillary wants from the Rules Committee: 1) don't count the caucus states Obama won, 2)count FL, 3) count MI but do not give Obama the uncommitted votes, and 4) seat all the delegates at full vote. If Hillary does not get EVERYTHING she wants, she's taking her fight to the convention. She is not prepared to compromise, and she is not prepared to help the Democratic nominee until the last possible second when it will be too late.

Given the utter lack of even the slightest disapproval of the caucus process before Clinton finished 3rd in IA, this line of argument is patently self-serving and offensive to those of us who have no other means of voting for our preferred candidate.

Unless Obama is coming to say that he has finally agreed to a Michigan and Florida revote, there is no need for any visit. He will all ready have 90-92% of the black votes and the remaining 8-10% plus Hillary supporters and the white Republican votes will go to McCain. We don't want NObama that was too cowardly to go along with a fair revote. He stole the nomination with his caucus states and states like NC that gave him an automatic (NON-RACIAL) 1/3% of the vote lead. (Then the MSM acted like it was a super unexpected major win) (What kind of a chance did Hillary have when 1/3 of the non-racist voters were committed to Obama?) Obama will be another weak Kerry in November and the Dems will be whining that the election was stolen, when in fact there were enough signs that he could not win. Wish Hillary would say screw the Dems and run as an independant like Joe Lieberman did. After the way the Dems have slandered and bad mouthed Bill Clinton's legacy the Dem party no longer deserves any loyalty. They tore apart one of the best presidents this country has had in years just to try to get Obama elected. They must really be planning some big chit with Obama. The Dems and the MSM need to start playing fair and the superdelegates need to keep in mind that over 17 MILLION Dems want Hillary for our next president.

With due respect for all this frothing, gnashing of teeth and other nonsense - about some miraculous recovery by a candidate who cannot possibly pull out a win in this primary - and the dire predictions of a certain defeat of the Democrat in November if we do not nominate one of the most distrusted candidates ever to run for national office -- there are a few other things that we need to be thinking about - including:
A continuing war in Iraq that has cost our nation more than 4,080 young kids killed and moreover, nearly 30,000 wounded grievously wounded. While we are witnessing a Republican candidate who claims all is going well in Iraq: we just have to stay the course - occupy the country like it was Korea - "Muslims will have to deal with it;"
That same continuing war in Iraq that is costing our treasury about 10-12 BILLION dollars each and every month with many other hidden costs - including the incalculable loss of our respect and honor in the world community;
An attenuated effort in Afghanistan - curtailed by the drain on our armed forces and treasury of an ill-conceived and hopelessly mismanaged effort in Iraq. AlQaeda is in the mountains between Pakistan and Afghanistan - Osama bin Muhammad bin 'Awad bin Laden is there...remember him?
A housing mortgage collapse that is driving down the value of all of our homes - for most of us our home is our greatest investment and we are losing money everyday;
And a credit market collapse that dwarfs the mortgage industry problems, and is threatening the very foundation of our capitalist society - here and among our allies.
Gasoline prices at the pump predicted to rise past $4.50 per gallon by the end of May - with our trucking industry on the verge of a national strike due to diesel fuel predicted to surpass $5.50 per gallon by mid-summer. Wonder what that will do to our economy?
Additionally, we see tens of thousands of workers losing their jobs every month while new jobs are not coming on line and the nation teetering on the edge of a very serious recession which will bring industry closures and hundreds of thousands of layoffs. 80,000 jobs lost in March and THREE AIRLINES declaring bankruptcy in one week.
And, you claim that McCain is going to win in November???
The Republicans are responsible for the mess this country is in. Yet, they are the ones on these discussion boards who want to talk about everything else. Let's face it - their leadership is terrified by the thought of Barack Obama becoming our President. Absolutely in a total panic! Silly Republicans! They are toast in November. They are holding the Bush legacy in their arms and it is ticking they do not like it.
November 2008 is going to be an electoral disaster for the Republican Party - thanks in the most part to the guidance of Dick Cheney, the ineptitude of Don Rumsfield, and the blind stubbornness of their "boss" - the Dunce of D.C.
Furthermore, take a moment and look around. Examine the total voter turnout in the 47 primary and caucus states who have cast ballots thus far. -- Notice anything?
I've noticed an overwhelming number of new voters and "recovered" voters rising from their "couches" and making the trek to the polls to cast a vote.
They are voting Democratic by more than a 2 to 1 majority.
Why?
"It's no mystery," said Rep. Thomas M. Davis III (R-Va.). "You have a very unhappy electorate, which is no surprise, with oil at $108 a barrel, stocks down a few thousand points, a war in Iraq with no end in sight and a president who is still very, very unpopular. He's just killed the Republican brand."
Well, the diehard "Bushies" chorus - "...just you wait for John McCain."
Well, "my friends" - the old Republican warrior has once again accepted the challenge to serve his country -- and he will throw himself on the "live grenade" of the George W. Bush legacy. And, as the vetting starts, he will be forced to explain some of the "dinosaur" skeletons hidden in his Arizona closet. Ask an Arizonan - any Arizonan.
So - to all the angry Bush apologists, desperate Hillary devotees and fatalistic McCain admirers watching this disaster slowly unfold before your eyes - you are now experiencing what we felt when the neo-cons duped the dope into invading Iraq.
We are going to have a Democrat in the White House and huge majorities of Democrats in both houses of the Congress. Huge majorities!
Obama will crush McCain in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and may beat him in Georgia and New Mexico. Democrats, Independents and many centrist Republicans have had it with any more Bush/McCain "policy fixes."
To those of you having a hard time keeping up - you had better take a deep breath and try to figure how you are going to survive the next 4 years -- because in your hearts, you KNOW this -- you are going to do it with Barack Obama in the Oval Office.

Sure bsimon, the democrats go around all year telling the people of Michigan their votes do not count, then Obama's people come in and do everything they can to PREVENT A re-vote.
The DNC appears perfectly happy to have a nominee without the people of Michigan and Florida counting.

Broccoli Obama reminds me of those three monkeys - see no evil, hear no evil , speak no evil.
He sat in the church for 20 years and didn't hear the evil.
He considers Iraq and terrorists and sees no evil.
He doesn't understand when Amajornutjob says he wants to kill us, that he intends to - yet Obambi believes that no one who speaks evil means it - speak no evil.

Yes. Why wouldn't they?

DCexpat -- In one way, you are right about the many differences among the electorate in Florida. North Florida is pretty much a southern state -- very conservative, but socially and religiously. The west coast of Florida has a lot of transplanted midwesterners, many of whom are conservative. Even the Democrats are somewhat conservative. Southeast Florida has a lot of transplanted New Yorkers and folks from New Jersey, in addition to the large Hispanic bloc. The older Cubans support the Republicans, but some of the younger ones are switching parties. I have read that the non-Cuban Latinos are trending Democratic. The large Jewish vote in south Florida has traditionally been Democratic, but I understand that some of them are worried about Senator Obama and may trebd Republican this year. Even though the state legislature is dominated by Republicans, I think the presidential election is up for grabs -- unless McCain chooses Crist as VP. It's going to be interesting.

I agree, a huge headwind for GOP makes Michigan pretty safe Dem territory this Nov.
I don't expect Mich has a real immigration problem, and they don't have enough people making real coin that a reduced spending/reduced taxes campaign will mean all that much.
Traditionally, the down-and-out will vote Dem (and their promises of free spending, healthcare, etc). Seems to me that Mich has more than their share of economic misery these days.

Don't you think you're nitpicking a bit? I don't recall which islands my grandfather was heading for on his LST when their battle group was told to 'stay the course' in the face of a coming storm. Relaying the order was the last time he spoke to one of his buddies, who was a radio operator on another vessel in the group - that sank in the storm. Family legend has it they were going to Iwo Jima. Or maybe it was one of the other ones. Is it really that important?
Obama told a story - a family legend - about events that happened over 60 years ago - before he was born, and you're getting your panties in a bunch about mistaking Buchenwald for Auschwitz? What difference does it make?

OBAMA CAN WIN. BUT NOT NOW. NOT THIS YEAR. BILL CLINTON HIMSELF SHOULD TAKE HIM ASIDE AND REALLY TELL HIM WHY.
If Obama makes it to the White House, he will be either co-opted or effectively destroyed by the entrenched forces on both sides of the political spectrum. Forget the merits of his argument for a moment; he simply cannot win because he's too new on the scene, too inexperienced, too outmatched by the intransigent realpolitik of the established order.
If he were smart, he would find a way to cede his campaign to a third candidate with whom his politics is compatible (such as Al Gore). Then he could put in his time and earn his executive stripes as VP and let the country get to really know him. As it is, much of the country feels as though they're being force-fed Obamamania, and they don't like the feel of coercion.
This talk on MSNBC today about Obama potentially choosing Hillary as his running mate, citing statements made by Obama in Florida this weekend, only makes Obama look weaker. The more he praises Hillary the more he reinforces the notion that he's a hopeless compromiser singing a single tune of "Kumbaya."
Mr. Obama, you are no Abraham Lincoln enlisting the aid of a cabinet of rivals -- not at this stage of the game, at least, despite what Doris Kearns Goodwin may say.
It does appear that Obama is something of a narcissist with a martyr complex. He needs a dose of "the audacity of maybe not now, but maybe later." Can't he see that the very forces that he seeks to lead simply will not accept his leadership at this time, at this stage of his very young career?
Bill Clinton should take Obama aside and schools him on the dangerous intrigues of national office and why it is impossible for Obama to succeed unless he takes a more calculated and circumloquitous path to the pinnacle of American power.
We're talking survival here. If Obama is to succeed, he first must preserve his political viability. That will be gone if he becomes the nominee and fails to make it all the way to the White House.
Obama is gifted, but extremely naive. He really thinks he can have it all after only three years on the national scene. He has a choice. He can become a historical footnote, yet another legendary dreamer who never made it to the mountaintop; or he can measure his steps on the path to power and delay his need for poltitical gratification until he can get it the old-fashioned way -- by paying his dues and earning it.

Michigan is going for McCain this year. Do you people really believe that after this DNC dispute the voters are going to go vote for Obama ???
I mean that thought is a little out there.
In addition all McCain has to do is run some commercials (which would be true) stating that the REAL REASON the DNC wanted to keep Michigan from voting early was to AVOID the issue of job losses in Michigan.
Carl Levin made that argument to the DNC and it was rejected.

"Obama went so far as to remove his name from the ballot..."
Check me on this, but didn't all the Dem candidates *except* Clinton remove their names from the ballot in Michigan?
I've seen this line several times recently, and it seems a strange, almost Clintonesque emphasis. I'm just sayin...
Posted by: nitpick | May 27, 2008 6:03 PM | Report abuse
Is Obama going to attempt to PREVENT the November election in Michigan as well ???
Lets' see - Obama needs to stop a few states from counting this fall.
So if he figures out a way to stop the Electoral votes from Texas, Georgia, Florida and Michigan - perhaps North Carolina too from counting, Obama should be able to win.
Obama needs to find a way to have 225 Electoral Votes be enough to win.

Meanwhile Obama's so called "mistakes" continue to pile up!
NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) - Barack Obama's campaign says the candidate made a mistake when he said a great uncle helped liberate the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz during World War II.
Obama said Monday that his uncle was among the first U.S. troops at Auschwitz. But Auschwitz was liberated by Soviet forces.
The campaign said Tuesday that he named the wrong camp. They said it was actually Buchenwald.
Aides said his grandmother's brother, Charlie Payne, helped liberate a Buchenwald sub-camp in April 1945 as part of the 89th Infantry Division.
Critics had been questioning Obama's original comment mentioning Auschwitz.

The polls are probably distorted by intra-Democratic resentment right now. In the heat of the Obama - Clinton endgame, a lot of Clinton partisans are probably polling as McCain voters. That resentment will presumably diminish once this thing is settled and the party professes unity... at which point one might expect a measurable dip in McCain's numbers against Obama.

Do we have any Michiganders in the house? Some on the ground insight would be appreciated.
DC expat makes a plausible argument that the GOP doesn't seem to have a lot to offer Michiganders right now, but I've also heard that many blame Dem Gov Granholm for some of the state's woes. If that's true, could MI be a surprise state for McCain this year?

What happens in Florida will be strange -- I think we can expect that. I've spent enough time in Florida and know so many completely different-thinking people who live there, that I can't say the state really HAS a political bias in either direction.
Michigan, however, is very likely go solidly Democratic. John McCain and the Republican party as it exists today has nothing in common with Michigan voters, and no particular "hope" to offer unless they have some economic magic potion to serve up we've not heard about.
Posted by: DC Expat in Durham NC | May 27, 2008 5:47 PM | Report abuse
Why are GOP strategists so down right now? By all accounts, up to 40% or so of Clinton's supporters intend to vote for McCain... at this time. Logic would say that number will decline as the election grows near. That means that Obama is likely polling at the lowest he will this election cycle.
He is still leading McCain in almost all national polls. This is McCain's zenith, and he is still losing.

2008: the stories
On the first day of 2008, at midnight, the Republic of Cyprus and the Republic of Malta , both small island states in the Mediterranean and former British colonies , adopted the euro as their official currency, less than four years after their accession to the European Union . Because Cyprus and Malta are in different time zones , Cyprus adopted the euro one hour before Malta did. In both countries the euro was welcomed with outdoor celebrations, including a fireworks display in the Maltese capital of Valletta .
Stock prices dropped sharply in Europe and Asia on January 21, with fears of economic problems in the United States causing some of the biggest single-day losses in recent years.
Although larger losses occurred later in the year, these falls were seen to be unusually large at the time.
February
NOAA storm report for February 5. Red dots indicate locations of Tornadoes
Tornadoes were reported across the southern United States, with some sources saying as many as 48 have died. At least 69 tornadoes were reported to have taken place in just two days, most of which took place on the same day as US citizens were voting in caucuses and primaries on a day known as super Tuesday.
Fidel Castro , who was the Cuban president who seized power in a 1959 revolution, stated in a quote in Cuba's state-run newspaper Granma that when the National Assembly of Cuba meets on February 24 he "will not aspire to or accept... the positions of President of Council of State and Commander in Chief."
March
Dmitry Medvedev, age 42, has won the presidential election in Russia and is expected to take office on May 7, 2008, replacing Vladimir Putin who has served two 4-year presidential terms since 2000. Medvedev has repeatedly promised to continue the political course of the current Russian government.
Former world chess champion Garry Kasparov, human rights activist Vladimir Bukovsky, reformer Boris Nemtsov and former Prime Minister Mikhail Kasyanov were all prohibited from taking part in the election for various technicalities. The Russian media have focused heavily on Medvedev while giving little attention to the opposition candidates.
April
Around 25 arrests have been made by Metropolitan Police officers, during the 31 mile Olympic Torch relay in London, England. Demonstrators attempted to extinguish the flame using a fire extinguisher, and grab the torch from the hands of TV presenter Konnie Huq in Ladbroke Grove.
The next day, the Olympic torch went out three times while traveling through Paris, France. Olympic officials claim that this came as a result of actions by Pro-Tibetan protesters. It has been reported that the torch was extinguished, then put on a bus to keep it safe. The torch was extinguished one time by a Chinese official when the torch was in the hands of David Douillet, and one time due to technical problems.
Police in the Lower Austrian town of Amstetten have arrested a 73 year old man who is alleged to have kept his daughter, now aged 42, locked in the cellar of his house in Amstetten since 29th August 1984.
The man, identified by police as Josef Fritzl , is alleged to have started sexually abusing his daughter, named as Elisabeth Fritzl, when she was eleven years old, and to have subsequently fathered seven children by her. Rosemarie F. is said to have been unaware of her husbands' activities. The news has shocked Austria , recalling the case of Natascha Kampusch who was kidnapped aged 10, and escaped after being held in a "dungeon" for eight years in 2006.
May
Cyclone Nargis
On May 16, state run television in Myanmar reported that the death toll from the recent cyclone increased dramatically to 77,738. In addition to that, 55,917 people were still officially missing.
June
July
Freed hostage Íngrid Betancourt arrived in France today, two days after being rescued from the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC), who had kept her captive in the Colombian jungle for more than six years.
"It's a completely hostile environment with dangerous animals," Betancourt said. "The most dangerous, of course, is man. Those men who were behind me with huge rifles, pushing me, telling me to walk, telling me to walk more quickly." She called on Sarkozy to continue working toward freeing the hostages who were left behind.
August
Brett Favre with the Jets.
Brett Favre , the National Football League 's all-time leader in passing yards, touchdowns, victories, and consecutive games started for a quarterback was traded to the New York Jets for a conditional draft pick in the 2009 NFL Draft . Favre, 38, had previously announced his retirement from the NFL in March but was reinstated after he voiced his intentions to return to play for the 2008 NFL season . Favre had previously played for the Green Bay Packers from 1992 to 2007. In 2008, Favre entered his 18th season in the NFL.
The War in South Ossetia escalated as Russian forces were sent into the conflict on the Ossetian side. The President of Georgia Mikheil Saakashvili announced the mobilization of reserve troops to withstand what he called "a large-scale military aggression" by Russia, and called Russia to stop the "bombardment of Georgian towns." The next day, Saakashvili declared a state of war.

September
Questions were raised on how thoroughly the staff of United States Senator and Presidential nominee John McCain had examined the background of his running mate, Governor Sarah Palin before announcing that he had selected her on August 29. McCain's advisers insisted that Palin was "thoroughly vetted," a process that would have included a review of all financial and legal records as well as a criminal background check.
The questions arose amid controversy that Palin's 17-year-old unmarried daughter Bristol was five months pregnant at the time and how Palin was possibly abusing her powers as Governor of Alaska in the "Troopergate" scandal. McCain was aware of Bristol Palin's pregnancy before he asked her mother to join him on the ticket and reportedly did not see the pregnancy as a detriment to Governor Palin's selection as the vice presidential candidate.
McCain had reportedly met Palin only twice before her selection, and had his first face-to-face interview with her on August 28. McCain offered Palin the vice presidential spot just moments after their meeting concluded. The two appeared at a campaign rally event the following morning in Dayton, Ohio .
A view of the LHC tunnel.
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that started preliminary experiments on September 10, 2008 in CERN, Geneva, and the planned International Linear Collider (ILC) will carry out a series of experiments in the future to validate the standard model of particle physics. The model predicts that Higgs boson particles gives mass to all fundamental particles and explains the existence of dark matter, or invisible matter in between galaxies.
The LHC is a 27 kilometer long circular high energy particle accelerator which took more than 20 years and USD $9 billion to build. In the next few weeks the machine will collide opposing beams of protons charged with approximately 7 TeV of energy resulting in cataclysmic conditions that will mimic the beginning of time, a re-creation of the Big Bang.
Almost 13,000 children in China have fallen sick in a wave of sickness caused by baby's milk contaminated with melamine. Most of the sickened children are infants two years or younger, and four children have died from the chemical so far.
In the milk incident, melamine was added to make the milk appear richer in protein. It caused an estimated 53,000 to become ill, mostly young children. The chemical can cause kidney stones and kidney failure.
The Chinese Health Ministry has stated that most of the tainted milk was produced by Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group Co.'s infant milk powder and have pulled several dairy products off the shelves of Chinese stores. Sanlu, Mengniu and Yili were among the largest brands recalled, and have been attempting to repair their damaged public image.
October
Thousands of civilians fled their homes on Saturday amid fierce fighting between local militias and Tutsi-dominated rebels in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, according to the U.N. peacekeeping mission there.
Congolese Army Colonel Delphin Kahimbi said that "very violent attacks" had been reported, and that the fighting was between local militia known as Mai-Mai and rebels loyal to renegade Tutsi general Laurent Nkunda. Major P.K. Tiwari, a military spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission, said the fighting "started early this morning and ended late this afternoon." Tiwari said it was not clear who had attacked first.
November
Election results
The 2008 Democratic presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois , 47, is projected to win at least 349 electoral votes, more than enough to clinch the Presidency of the United States . Obama is the first African American to be elected President in U.S. history. His Republican opponent, Arizona Senator John McCain , is projected to win at least 173 electoral votes. McCain has phoned Obama to concede the election. Obama officially became the President-elect when John McCain issued his concession speech shortly after 9:00 p.m. Mountain Time.
Scores of people have been killed, and many more wounded, in what appear to have been coordinated attacks by gunmen wielding automatic weapons and hand grenades. The attacks began around 10:30 p.m. IST in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.
Police reports indicate at least 80 deaths and a further 900 injured. More conservative estimates place the death toll at 78 with over 200 injured. According to television reports, a little-known group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen has claimed responsibility.
Sites of the attacks have been listed as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station, a hospital, a police station and at least three hotels, including Oberoi Trident and Taj Mahal Palace & Tower. The Marriott Hotel in Juhu has been attacked with gunfire, but details are sketchy. A restaurant, Leopold Cafe on Colaba Causeway was also attacked.
December
December 14: Iraqi journalist throws shoes at US president George Bush
Bush and al-Maliki shake hands during the press conference, following the signing of the Strategic Framework Agreement.
An Iraqi journalist for an Egyptian Newspaper named Muntazer al-Zaidi was tackled by authorities after he threw his shoes at United States president George W. Bush during a press conference on Sunday in Baghdad.
Before throwing his shoes at Bush, the reporter stood up and said, "This is a farewell kiss from the Iraqi people, dog!" The words were followed by the reporter's two shoes being thrown at Bush, who had to duck in order to avoid being hit with them.
In Arabic culture, hitting or throwing shoes at someone so the soles hit them is considered a great insult.
Israel has launched over 30 simultaneous missiles strikes on Hamas installations in Gaza City, causing heavy damage and claiming at least 220 lives. The attack was allegedly a retaliation against frequent Palestinian Qassam rocket and mortar fire on Israel's southern communities.

Noordin Mohammad Top
Financier, alleged trainer of the splinter group of Jemaah Islamiyah
Criminal penalty
Deceased Autumn 2009
Noordin Mohammad Top (11 August 1968 – 17 September 2009), of Malaysian citizenship, was a Muslim extremist, also referred to as (Noordin) Din Moch Top, Muh Top, or Mat Top, and Indonesia 's most wanted Islamist militant . [1] [2] Born in Kluang , Johor , Malaysia , he is thought to have been a key bomb maker and/or financier for Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and to have left JI and set up a more violent splinter group Tanzim Qaedat al-Jihad . [3] Noordin was reported by the FBI to be "an explosives expert". The FBI also has reported him to be "an officer, recruiter, bomb maker and trainer for the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) group." [4]
Noordin, allegedly nicknamed "Money man", was an indoctrinator who was specialised in recruiting militants into becoming suicide bombers and collecting funds for militant activities. [7]
Having long since been wanted by Malaysian and Indonesian authorities he was added to the FBI's third major "wanted" list in 2006. FBI Seeking Information - War on Terrorism list . [8]
He was killed during a police raid in Solo, Central Java , on the 17th of September 2009 conducted by the Indonesian anti-terrorist team, Densus 88 . [9]
Contents
It is thought that Noordin may have assisted in planning the 2002 Bali Bombings , in which 202 people were killed. [6]
On the 5th of August 2003 a suicide bomber detonated a car bomb outside the lobby of the JW Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, killing 12 people and injuring 150. Jemaah Islamiyah was suspected of responsibility for the bombing. [10]
In July 2004 a car bomb was exploded outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta, killing several people including the suicide bomber and wounding over 140 others. [11] Jemaah Islamiyah with Azahari Husin and Noordin M. Top were suspected of being behind the bombing. [12]
On the 1st of October 2005 bombs were detonated in Jimbaran and Kuta in Bali. The bombings killed 23 people, including three bombers trained by Noordin. [9] [13]
In July 2009, two suicide bombers killed seven people at the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott hotels in Jakarta. Local anti-terrorism officials said that there were "strong indications" that Noordin Top was behind the attacks. [4]
On 21 July 2005, Irun Hidayat was convicted of being an accessory by providing a house to Azahari Husin and Noordin Top.
After the October 2005 attack, a Philippine security official said that for months intelligence officials in Southeast Asia had received information that the al-Qaeda -linked Jemaah Islamiyah group was orchestrating a major strike, possibly in the Philippines or Indonesia, but were unable to uncover the plot's details in time to prevent it. [14]
Mbai identified the chief suspect in the 2005 attack as Azahari Husin, who was thought to collaborate with the second suspect Noordin, whose wife was sentenced to three years in prison for harbouring him. [15] Azahari Husin was later killed in a raid in November 2005.
On the 24th of February 2006 the FBI added Noordin among three names to the Seeking Information – War on Terrorism list. [16]
On the 29th of April 2006 he narrowly escaped capture after his safe-house was raided by heavily armed Indonesian police in Binangun , Central Java . In the altercation, Abdul Hadi and Jabir were killed. [17]
In June 2006 it was reported that Noordin was threatening more attacks in video tapes recovered by Indonesian authorities and police believe that he may have formed his own organisation outside JI. [18]
On the 8th of August 2009 there were media reports that he had been killed during a shooting with police near Temanggung , a village in Central Java . Forensic testing conducted by Indonesian police however, disproved this speculation. A body recovered from the ambush site was instead found to be Ibrohim, a key organiser of the 2009 Jakarta bombings . [19]
Indonesian National Police Chief Bambang Hendarso Danuri announced on the 17th of September 2009 that Noordin was killed in a police raid along with three other terrorists. Police hunting for suspects in bombings of July 2009 tracked the seven suspects to Solo in Central Java and besieged a village house on the outskirts overnight. The raid ended near daybreak when an explosion was detonated inside the home. Four suspected militants were killed and three were captured. The operation left behind a charred house with no roof and blown-out walls. The bodies were flown to Jakarta for autopsies. [20]
Among the four bodies recovered after the raid a corpse was identified as Noordin's; [21] fingerprints taken from the Indonesian corpse matched samples obtained from Malaysia. A similarity was found in at least 14 minutiae points. [22] On 19 September 2009, Indonesian National Police spokesperson announced that a DNA test was also carried out and it was proved that the body is Noordin's. [23] According to a police intelligence officer, the renter of the house, "Susilo", Noordin's close associate Bagus Budi Pranoto, alias "Urwah" and Aryo Sudarso, alias Mistam Hisamuddin, were killed in the raid, along with Noordin. [24] Police were led to the house after arresting Indonesian militant Rohmat Puji Prabowo at a marketplace in Solo on 16 September. [25]
Sidney Jones, the South east Asia programme director of the International Crisis Group commented that Noordin's death was "a huge blow for the extremist organizations in Indonesia and the region", because "there isn't another radical leader in Indonesia who has given that same message so consistently." [1]
During his exiles and escapes from police raids, Noordin married several women in Indonesia and produced several children from those marriages.
He married Munfiatun AKA Fitri on the 7th of July 2004. Fitri was sentenced to three years in prison for protecting him. He also married an unidentified woman in Rokan Hilir , Riau , during his exile after the first Bali Bombing . Around 2007, he also married Ariani Rahma during his exile in Cilacap . One other unidentified woman was also believed to be Noordin's wife during his time in police custody. These marriages were believed to be a part of his strategy to socialize with the local people in order to keep his identity secret. His first wife was an Indonesian-born Malaysian woman, who now lives in Johor , Malaysia , with their son. [26] [27]

Noordin Mohammad Top, Indonesia's Most Wanted Islamic Militant, Is Killed in a Police Raid
Noordin Mohammad Top, aka Noordin Muh Top, Noordin Mat Top, and Noordin Din Moch Top (11 August 1968 – 17 September 2009) was Indonesia's most wanted Islamic militant.
Born in Kluang, Johor, Malaysia, he is thought to have been a key bomb maker and/or financier for Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and to have left JI and set up a more violent splinter group known as Al-Qaeda in the Malay Archipelago. Top was reported by the United States Department of Justice's FBI to be "an explosives expert." The FBI also has reported him to be "an officer, recruiter, bombmaker, and trainer for the Jemaah Islamiah (JI) group."
Noordin and Azahari Husin were thought to have masterminded the 2003 JW Marriott hotel bombing in Jakarta, the 2004 Australian embassy bombing in Jakarta, the 2005 Bali bombings and the 2009 JW Marriott - Ritz-Carlton bombings, and that he may have assisted in the 2002 Bali Bombings.
Indonesian National Police Chief Bambang Hendarso Danuri announced on 17 September 2009 that Noordin Mohammed Top was killed in a police raid along with three other terrorists. Among four bodies recovered after the raid on a village house in Central Java, a decapitated corpse was identified as Noordin's—fingerprints taken from it matched those of Noordin that were obtained from Malaysia. A similarity was found in at least 14 minutiae points. According to a police intelligence officer, the renter of the house, "Susilo", Noordin's close associate Bagus Budi Pranoto, alias "Urwah", and suspected bomb-maker "Maruto", were killed in the raid, along with Noordin.
Sidney Jones, the Southeast Asia programme director of the International Crisis Group, commented that Top's death was "a huge blow for the extremist organizations in Indonesia and the region" because "there isn't another radical leader in Indonesia who has given that same message so consistently."

In July 2004 a car bomb was exploded outside the Australian embassy in Jakarta, killing several people including the suicide bomber and wounding over 140 others. [11] Jemaah Islamiyah with Azahari Husin and Noordin M. Top were suspected of being behind the bombing. [12]
On 1 October 2005 bombs were detonated in Jimbaran and Kuta in Bali. The bombings killed 23 people, including three bombers trained by Noordin. [9] [13]
In July 2009, two suicide bombers killed seven people at the Ritz Carlton and JW Marriott hotels in Jakarta. Local anti-terrorism officials said that there were "strong indications" that Noordin Top was behind the attacks. [4]
Fugitive trail
On 21 July 2005, Irun Hidayat was convicted of being an accessory by providing a house to Azahari Husin and Noordin Top.
After the October 2005 attack, a Philippine security official said that for months intelligence officials in Southeast Asia had received information that the al-Qaeda -linked Jemaah Islamiyah group was orchestrating a major strike, possibly in the Philippines or Indonesia, but were unable to uncover the plot's details in time to prevent it. [14]
Mbai identified the chief suspect in the 2005 attack as Azahari Husin, who was thought to collaborate with the second suspect Noordin, whose wife was sentenced to three years in prison for harbouring him. [15] Azahari Husin was later killed in a raid in November 2005.
On 24 February 2006 the FBI added Noordin among three names to the Seeking Information – War on Terrorism list. [16]
On 29 April 2006 he narrowly escaped capture after his safe-house was raided by heavily armed Indonesian police in Binangun, Central Java . In the altercation, Abdul Hadi and Jabir were killed. [17]
In June 2006 it was reported that Noordin was threatening more attacks in video tapes recovered by Indonesian authorities and police believe that he may have formed his own organisation outside JI. [18]
On 8 August 2009 there were media reports that he had been killed during a shooting with police near Temanggung , a village in Central Java . Forensic testing conducted by Indonesian police however, disproved this speculation. A body recovered from the ambush site was instead found to be Ibrohim, a key organiser of the 2009 Jakarta bombings . [19]
Death
Indonesian National Police Chief Bambang Hendarso Danuri announced on 17 September 2009 that Noordin was killed in a police raid along with three other terrorists. Police hunting for suspects in bombings of July 2009 tracked the seven suspects to Solo in Central Java and besieged a village house on the outskirts overnight. The raid ended near daybreak when an explosion was detonated inside the home. Four suspected militants were killed and three were captured. The operation left behind a charred house with no roof and blown-out walls. The bodies were flown to Jakarta for autopsies. [20]
Among the four bodies recovered after the raid a corpse was identified as Noordin's; [21] fingerprints taken from the Indonesian corpse matched samples obtained from Malaysia. A similarity was found in at least 14 minutiae points. [22] On 19 September 2009, Indonesian National Police spokesperson announced that a DNA test was also carried out and it was proved that the body is Noordin's. [23] According to a police intelligence officer, the renter of the house, "Susilo", Noordin's close associate Bagus Budi Pranoto, alias "Urwah" and Aryo Sudarso, alias Mistam Hisamuddin, were killed in the raid, along with Noordin. [24] Police were led to the house after arresting Indonesian militant Rohmat Puji Prabowo at a marketplace in Solo on 16 September. [25]
Sidney Jones, the South east Asia programme director of the International Crisis Group commented that Noordin's death was "a huge blow for the extremist organizations in Indonesia and the region", because "there isn't another radical leader in Indonesia who has given that same message so consistently." [1]
Wives
During his exiles and escapes from police raids, Noordin married several women in Indonesia and produced several children from those marriages.
He married Munfiatun AKA Fitri on 7 July 2004. Fitri was sentenced to three years in prison for protecting him. He also married an unidentified woman in Rokan Hilir , Riau , during his exile after the first Bali Bombing . Around 2007, he also married Ariani Rahma during his exile in Cilacap . One other unidentified woman was also believed to be Noordin's wife during his time in police custody. These marriages were believed to be a part of his strategy to socialise with the local people to keep his identity secret. His first wife was an Indonesian-born Malaysian woman, who now lives in Johor , Malaysia , with their son. [26] [27]

BEJI, Indonesia - Police reportedly killed the self-proclaimed Southeast Asian commander of al-Qaeda Saturday after a 16-hour seige, but authorities said they could not confirm that a body recovered from a village hideout was that of Noordin Mohammad Top .
Local TV stations reported that the suspected terror mastermind suspected in last month's attacks on two American hotels in the capital, Jakarta , as well as the deaths of more than 220 people on Bali , was killed in the bathroom of the house in a rice-growing village following a lengthy bomb and gun battle.
The remains of a man believed to be Noordin were flown from central Java to Jakarta for an autopsy, but police "cannot yet confirm that this is Noordin Top," national police chief Bambang Hendarso Damuri said.
Police don't want to say that Noordin is assumed dead and any announcement will have to wait until next week after a DNA examination is complete, Hendarso said at nationally televised news conference. It was unclear if the police have a sample on file that can be used for that DNA test.
The suicide attacks on the J.W. Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in Jakarta killed seven people, all but one of them foreigners, and ended a four-year pause in terror strikes in Indonesia, the world's most populous Muslim-majority nation.
Noordin is also believed to have orchestrated an earlier attack on the J.W. Marriott Hotel in 2003 and a blast outside the Australian Embassy in 2004, both in the Indonesian capital, which killed dozens and wounded hundreds.
Those early attacks were blamed on the regional terrorist network Jemaah Islamiyah and funded by al-Qaida, but Noordin later broke away to form a more violent offshoot and the foreign ties to his group became uncertain. It is unknown how the July 17 suicide blasts were funded.
After the Bali 2002 bombing, Noordin emerged as the most prominent regional terrorist leader and a skilled bomb maker who has eluded capture for around seven years, despite a massive crackdown by Indonesian authorities. A Malaysian citizen, Noordin claimed in a video in 2005 to be al-Qaeda's representative in Southeast Asia and to be carrying out attacks on Western civilians to avenge Muslim deaths in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Killing or capturing him would be a major victory in Indonesia's fight against militants and could significantly weaken the chances of more attacks, given the key planning, financial and motivational role he is believed to have played in terror networks.
Minutes after the raid, witnesses said officers outside the house took off their helmets and were shaking hands with each other, suggesting all those inside had either been killed or captured. The firing ceased.
A police officer at the scene said a body was found in the bathroom of the house and authorities brought a coffin there. After about one hour, three ambulances left the home.
President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono told reporters he had been briefed about an ongoing operation "to uphold law and to eradicate terrorism," but made no mention of Noordin. Still, he praised police.
"I extend my highest gratitude and respect to the police for their brilliant achievement in this operation," he said.
Earlier Saturday, officers raided a second house close to Jakarta where they shot and killed two suspected militants and seized bombs and a car rigged to carry them, said Police chief Gen. Bambang Hendarso Danuri.
Danuri said one of those arrested had reserved a room in one of the hotels that was used by the terrorists before they attacked.
The house was about three miles (five kilometers) from the residence of President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono. The Detik.com Web site, quoting an unnamed police source, said officers believed they were planning to attack Yudhoyono's house.
Officers circled the house in central Java province late Friday afternoon after making arrests in a nearby town. At one point, they sent remote-controlled robots into the isolated building to search for bombs.
Not long before they stormed the red-tiled building, officers dressed in black behind a shield fired into the house from close range, while others fired repeated volleys from a hill behind it.
Indonesian police have been met with booby traps and suicide bombers in at least one other raid on a terrorist hide-out and approached the house with extreme caution.
Indonesian police have arrested more than 200 militants associated with the Jemaah Islamiyah terror network since 2002, including many with ties to Noordin, who they say has narrowly escaped capture several times.
Police have offered a $100,000 reward for information leading to his capture. Experts say Noordin was likely being hidden by a small network of sympathizers who might not agree with his tactics, but nevertheless believe they have a duty to shelter him.
Java, home to more than half of Indonesia's 235 million people, has long been the focus in the hunt for Noordin and his associates.
In November 2005, Azahari bin Husin , a top Jemaah Islamiyah bomb maker, was fatally shot by counterterrorism forces in east Java. Sariyah Jabir , another explosives expert, was killed in April 2006 during a raid on a militant hide-out in central Java.
Together the bombings allegedly linked to Noordin killed more than 240 people, many of them Western tourists.

Leading militant Noordin reported killed in Indonesian raids
CBC News Posted: Aug 07, 2009 11:17 PM ET Last Updated: Aug 07, 2009 11:10 PM ET
Indonesian police have killed a man suspected of being militant Noordin Mohammad Top, who is believed to be behind last month's suicide bombings of two luxury hotels in Jakarta, according to several sources.
Police raided one house and besieged another Friday, killing two suspected militants, arresting five and seizing explosives and a car bomb, a senior police officer said.
The developments appeared to be the first major break in the investigations into the attacks, which killed nine people.

Throughout the night, local media reported that Noordin was holed up in one of the houses. Unconfirmed reports said he was one of those killed or arrested. Another report said he may have been wounded.
Police sources told Reuters that a man suspected to be Noordin was killed in a raid.
"He was shot dead at the workshop in Temanggung," one source said.
A source in Indonesia's anti-terrorism unit, Detachment 88, also told the news agency that police believed Noordin had been killed.
Noordin is suspected in all of Indonesia's major terrorist attacks since 2002, including blasts on the resort island of Bali in 2002 that killed 202 people, most of them foreign tourists.
2 suspected militants holding bombs killed
One of Saturday's raids took place close to Jakarta, the capital.
Police Chief Gen. Bambang Hendarso Danuri said two suspected militants holding bombs were killed, while three were arrested, one of whom reserved a room in one of the hotels that was used by the terrorists before they attacked last month.
He said officers seized explosives and a car bomb that was intended for "a specific target" but gave no more details.
Meanwhile, dozens of anti-terrorism officers moved in on a house in a village in central Java province where they said three or four other militants loyal to Noordin were holed up.
After a 10-hour siege in which the militants and police exchanged gunfire, a loud explosion was heard at the house as dawn broke. Officers sent remote-controlled robots into the home to search for bombs, a witness said. Local media reported Noordin was believed to be inside in the house.
Danuri said two suspected militants were arrested at the house or nearby.
Noordin is a Malaysian citizen who claimed in a video in 2005 to be al-Qaeda's representative in Southeast Asia and to be carrying out attacks on Western civilians to avenge Muslim deaths in Afghanistan.
