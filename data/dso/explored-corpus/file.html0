He is now in extrajudicial detention in the United States 's Guantanamo Bay detainment camps , in Cuba . [2]
Hambali was often described as "the Osama bin Laden of Southeast Asia ". Some media reports describe him as Bin Laden's lieutenant for Southeast Asian operations. Other reports describe him as an independent peer. He was highly trusted by Al Qaeda and was the main link between the two organisations. Hambali was a close friend of Khalid Shaikh Mohammed , who planned Operation Bojinka and the September 11 Terrorist Attacks . Hambali envisioned creating a Muslim state, in the form of an Islamic superpower (a theocracy ) across Southeast Asia , with himself as its leader ( Caliph ). His ambition was to rule Indonesia , Malaysia , Singapore , Brunei and parts of the Philippines , Myanmar , and Thailand [3] [4]
He received increasing attention in the aftermath of the 2002 Bali nightclub bombing , in which 202 people died. According to the Office of the Director of National Intelligence he served as the third in command of Al Qaeda, from the 2003 capture of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed to his own capture in 2005. [5] He was eventually apprehended in a joint operation by the CIA and Thai police. He is currently imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay detention center in Cuba, after three years of CIA custody in a secret location.

In 1991, Nurjamin returned to Cianjur for one week, before going to Malaysia , where he met the two co-founders of JI, Abdullah Sungkar and Abubakar Bashir . The three lived in a housing compound in Kampung Sungai Manggis, Banting , Selangor . Nurjaman internationalized the terrorist group's activities and took on a new name in his permanent residence permit: Riduan Isamuddin. His nickname, Hambali, is an allusion to Hanbali , an Islamic school of jurisprudence.
The two co-founders sent their students to "study" in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The students actually fought the Soviets until the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan. A woman named Noralwizah Lee Abdullah had gone to Malaysia for religious schooling. She secretly married Isamuddin after meeting him at the Luqmanul Hakiem School in Ulu Tiram , Johor . The school was founded by Sungkar and Bashir.
Initially, Isamuddin struggled to make a living for his family. He switched from selling kebabs to patenting medicines. He soon disappeared from his home for weeks at a time, and he received many visitors at home. He eventually came to own a red hatchback and several cell phones. Investigators say that many calls on those cell phones were made to Mohammed Jamal Khalifa , Osama bin Laden's brother in law, who had arrived back in Manila , Philippines in 1991.
After Arab visitors gave his family lots of money, he founded a shell company , Konsojaya , in June 1994. Ostensibly an import-export company trading in palm oil between Malaysia and Afghanistan , it was essentially a front company for terrorism.[ citation needed ] Wali Khan Amin Shah , who would become the financier of Operation Bojinka , was a director of Konsojaya. The company provided financial assistance to the project until it was discovered by investigators on a laptop computer after an apartment fire on January 6, 1995. Shah was arrested in the Philippines but escaped on a short order. Shah was arrested in Malaysia in December 1995. Both Shah and mastermind Ramzi Yousef , who escaped the Philippines but was arrested in Lahore , Pakistan , were extradited to the United States . They were both convicted and sentenced to life in prison for participating in the project.
Hambali goes underground[ edit ]
Hambali's company attracted attention of investigators so his dealings went quiet for a while.[ citation needed ] He decided to preach, raise money, and recruit for his cause. He went underground in 2000 and started a wave of church-bombings in Indonesia. He always had a "hands-on" technique; he met his foot soldiers and came to them "with detailed plans, plenty of cash and two of his own bombmakers." He always fled before the bombing commenced. Meanwhile, the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah, Abu Bakr Bashir , was preaching jihad at his schools while denying links to Islamic militants.[ citation needed ]
Hambali planned and attended the January 2000 Al Qaeda Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia . Among the others present were two September 11 hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi . This gathering in Kuala Lumpur was observed by the CIA and Malaysian authorities, but what specifically was being said at the meetings was not picked up. Hambali also provided money and documents to Zacarias Moussaoui in October of that year.
After the Bali nightclub bombing , in which 202 people were killed, Hambali received more attention from the United States. In the years leading up to the attack, the Indonesian government's action against Islamic militants had been minimal. Following the attack, Abu Bakr Bashir was arrested as part of a crack down on Jemaah Islamiah. He was wanted in Indonesia [10] for the bombings of several churches in the region, and wanted for the Bali bombing and a failed plot on several targets in Singapore.
Hambali used a series of safe-houses throughout Southeast Asia , especially Thailand and Cambodia , to move around. While he was in Ayutthaya , Thailand , 75 kilometers north of Bangkok , he was planning a terrorist attack against several Thai hotels and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit (APEC) in Bangkok on October 2003. Hambali had used a false Spanish passport to enter Thailand while his wife used her Malaysian passport.
Thai police found him as part of a joint operation between the Thai police and the CIA on August 11, 2003. The twenty uniformed and undercover police smashed down the door to his one bedroom apartment in Ayutthaya, and arrested him and 33-year-old Noralwizah Lee Abdullah, a Chinese Malaysian who was considered to be his wife. Hambali was wearing a pair of jeans, a t-shirt, a baseball cap, and a pair of sunglasses. Police also seized explosives and firearms in the property. It marked the end of a 20-month hunt for Hambali, who was 37 years of age when he was captured.
A 2006 Human Rights Watch report stated that Hambali was imprisoned in Jordan for the account of the CIA .[ citation needed ] On September 6, 2006, President George W. Bush confirmed that Hambali had been held by the CIA and revealed that he had been transferred to Guantanamo Bay . [11] His wife is now in Malaysian custody.
On September 8, 2006 Indonesia formally requested access to Hambali to ensure a fair trial . [12] The United States are reluctant to hand him over because of the lenient sentence Indonesia imposed on Bashir.[ citation needed ]
Hambali is also wanted in the Philippines for the transfer of explosives on Filipino soil in an attempt to transport them to Singapore .
Following his capture the USA would not confirm or deny that he was in their custody. But on September 6, 2006, President Bush acknowledged [13] the existence of covert, overseas CIA interrogation centres (colloquially known as black sites ) and announced that 14 high-profile members al Qaeda and related groups had been transported from those sites to Guantanamo Bay. [14] Those 14 include Hambali and an alleged lieutenant of his called Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep alias Lillie or Li-Li.
Combatant Status Review[ edit ]
the protections of the Geneva Conventions did not extend to captured prisoners who are not members of the regular Afghan armed force nor meet the criteria for prisoner of war for voluntary forces. [15]
Critics argued the Conventions obliged the U.S. to conduct competent tribunals to determine the status of prisoners. Subsequently, the U.S. Department of Defense instituted Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs), to determine whether detainees met the new definition of an " enemy combatant ".
"Enemy combatant" was defined by the U.S. Department of Defense as:
an individual who was part of, or supporting, the Taliban, or al-Qaeda forces, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. This includes any person who commits a belligerent act or has directly supported hostilities in aid of enemy armed forces. [16]
The CSRTs are not bound by the rules of evidence that would normally apply in civilian court, and the government’s evidence is presumed to be “genuine and accurate.” [17] From July 2004 through March 2005, CSRTs were convened to determine whether each prisoner had been correctly classified as an "enemy combatant".
Riduan Isamuddin was among the 60% of prisoners who chose to participate in tribunal hearings. [18] A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for the tribunal of each detainee, listing the allegations that supported their detention as an "enemy combatant".
Riduan Isamuddin's memo accused him of the following: [19]
The Department of Defense announced on August 9, 2007 that all fourteen of the "high-value detainees" who had been transferred to Guantanamo from the CIA's black sites , had been officially classified as "enemy combatants". [20] Although judges Peter Brownback and Keith J. Allred had ruled two months earlier that only "illegal enemy combatants" could face military commissions, the Department of Defense waived the qualifier and said that all fourteen men could now face charges before Guantanamo military commissions . [21] [22]
Possible transfer to Washington DC for a civilian trial[ edit ]
According to Xinhua the Obama Presidency is considering transferring Riduan Isamuddin to Washington DC for a civilian trial. [23]
Some of the above information about Hambali, and more, can be read in the report [8] of the 9-11 Commission.

Analysis
Riduan Isamuddin (also known as Hambali) is an Indonesian citizen who was captured in August 2003 in Ayuttaya, a Thai city 50 miles to the north of Bangkok, by a joint force of Thai and US security forces. The US Government accuses Hambali of being the operational commander of Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and a lead member of al-Qaeda responsible for multiple bombings in Southeast Asia, including the Bali bombings of October 2002 which killed over 200 people. He has been classified as a ‘High-Value Detainee’ (HVD), and was held for over three years in secret detention before being transferred to Guantánamo Bay in September 2006, where he remains.
Hambali was captured in a joint Thai-CIA operation in Ayuttaya on 11 August 2003, several hours after his associate, Lillie , was captured in Bangkok. He was initially held in US custody in a secret location in Thailand for 3-4 days, during which time he has testified that he was made to stand in a stress position with his hands cuffed to a hook in the ceiling, and kept naked, blindfolded and with a sack over his head.
Hambali’s continued secret detention in Afghanistan was confirmed in September 2003 by a senior Asian intelligence officer ‘with access to key interrogation records’ . This official stated that he was being held and interrogated at Bagram Airbase, alongside Zubair and Lillie . Hambali has testified that he was kept naked for most of the first six weeks of his detention in Afghanistan. Clothes were provided during the second week, but then removed again. He has also said that he was beaten repeatedly, with his interrogators placing a thick collar around his neck and then slamming him against walls.
The fate and whereabouts of Hambali after the initial six weeks of his detention in Afghanistan is unclear. Indeed, the only fact which has been made public regarding Hambali’s treatment after Afghanistan comes from his testimony to the International Committee of the Red Cross, where he states that in his third place of detention ‘he was threatened with a return to previous methods of ill-treatment (namely, having his head slammed against the wall by use of a collar), by his interrogators showing him the collar during interrogation sessions’.
Some reports have suggested that Hambali was held on the British island territory of Diego Garcia at some point after his capture, with Time magazine running a story in October 2003 which cited a ‘regional intelligence official’ to this effect. Indeed, the Council of Europe’s Rapporteur investigating European complicity in US renditions and secret detention – Dick Marty – claimed in his 2007 final report that ‘we have received concurring confirmations that United States agencies have used the island territory of Diego Garcia... in the “processing” of high-value detainees’. The UN Special Rapporteur on Torture, Manfred Novak, also claimed in 2008 that he had ‘received credible evidence from well-placed sources familiar with the situation on the island that detainees were held on Diego Garcia between 2002 and 2003’. However, neither Marty nor Novak named any detainees in particular, and there is little in the way of concrete evidence to suggest that Hambali was among those who may have been detained on the island. In particular, the Time story is based largely on records obtained of Hambali’s interrogations on 22 and 26 August, and it is likely that these were in fact from his detention in Afghanistan.
Hambali has also been cited by the Associated Press’ Adam Goldman as having been detained in Morocco and then Romania during 2004 and 2005, although again there is little in the way of detailed evidence in the public domain to support such assertions. Click here for further analysis of where the HVDs – including Hambali – may have been held during 2005-2006 .
On 4 September 2006, Hambali was transferred along with 13 other HVDs out of the CIA’s secret prison network and into US military detention in Guantánamo Bay. This final transfer was announced by President Bush two days later , as part of a wider disclosure about the CIA’s use of secret prisons.
Hambali remains detained in Guantánamo Bay.
 
 
 

Riduan Isamuddin (alias Hambali) « Tea and Politics Posts about Riduan Isamuddin (alias Hambali) written by Claudia. Tea and Politics Facts do not cease to exist because they are ignored (A. Huxley) Search. Home; About ... As they struggled from the wreckage, poor Muslim congregations came to depend on foreign charities for help rebuilding their mosques, whose numbers have risen tenfold to around 250 today, says Bjorn Blengsi, an anthropologist. They also became receptive to imported versions of Islam, which tend to be stricter than the traditionally relaxed local variety. Agnès de Féo, another anthropologist and author of “ L’Islam au Cambodge et au Vietnam” says both Wahhabism from Saudi Arabia and Tablighi Jemaat from India are gaining adherents.
Nothing wrong with that, perhaps. Most Islamic charities teach the faith and help the poor. But not, alas, all. In one much-publicised incident in 2002, according to the American government, a local member of the Kuwaiti-based Revival of Islamic Heritage Society (RIHS) helped an Indonesian fugitive, Riduan Isamuddin (alias Hambali), the mastermind behind the nightclub bombings in Bali. Hambali, who is now in prison in Guantánamo Ba y, reportedly said he had hoped to bomb the American and British embassies in Phnom Penh and to use Cambodia as a base for terrorist operations throughout South-East Asia. RIHS, which has been cleared of links with terrorism by Kuwait’s government, remains active in Cambodia. A local affiliate, the Kuwait-Cambodia Islamic Cultural Training Centre, recently met the president of parliament.
T he influence of foreign religious organisations seems to be growing along with rising government loans from Gulf states. These loans include help for rebuilding religious institutions. In January, for example, Cambodia approved an agreement with Kuwait from 2008 in which the oil-rich state promised loans of $546m, mostly for energy and agriculture, and including $5m for new mosques and madrassas (Islamic schools). The only unusual thing about this was that the religious component was revealed. According to Milton Osborne of the Lowy Institute, an Australian think-tank, most aid packages from the Gulf include such a component but do not make it public.

JEMAAH ISLAMIYAH (JI) STILL WORKING WITH MILF ... Indonesian terror chief Riduan Isamuddin, alias Hambali, ... Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), ... JEMAAH ISLAMIYAH (JI) STILL WORKING WITH MILF
MANILA, OCTOBER 7, 2003 (STAR) Indonesian terror chief Riduan Isamuddin, alias Hambali, confirmed to US investigators that there are definite links between the terror groups al-Qaeda, Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) and the separatist Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), Time magazine reported.
According to this week�s issue of Time, Hambali told his American interrogators that some $27,000 (about P1.5 million) from the al-Qaeda fund was transferred to the MILF sometime between July and August.
The Time exclusive was the most detailed confirmation yet of US Ambassador Francis Ricciardone�s claim that the JI has set up terrorist cells in Mindanao, threatening the pledged $30-million US development aid to MILF areas if it maintains ties with terrorists and outlaws.
But the MILF continued to deny the charge, with MILF vice chairman Ghadzali Jaafar saying "all maneuvers are being done to pressure us."
According to the report on Hambali�s interrogation, a copy of which Time obtained, al-Qaeda also sent money to fund future attacks on targets such as the US and British embassies in Bangkok, nightclubs in Thailand and shopping malls in Makati City.
Hambali himself scouted the Israeli embassy and a synagogue, also in Makati City, according to the interrogation report, because "Jewish targets were always the main priority."
Hambali also confirmed suspicions that JI members train in MILF camps and that it is "most likely (that) a large number of members of JI Indonesia are hiding in the Philippines and supporting the MILF."
According to the interrogation report, Hambali said al-Qaeda sent him $30,000 to finance the bombing of two nightclubs in Bali that left 202 people dead.
"Al-Qaeda was highly satisfied with the Bali bombing and as a result provided additional money" totaling $100,000, an interrogation report said.
From that money, $45,000 was given to JI in Indonesia, Hambali said. Another $15,000 was to support the families of the imprisoned Bali bombers and $30,000 was to finance new attacks.
Hambali said some of the money could have been used for the August bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta, where 12 people were killed, the magazine said.
Hambali, who was captured in Thailand on Aug. 11, is under interrogation at the US-British air base in the British island of Diego Garcia in the Indian Ocean.
Hambali is believed to be al-Qaeda�s Asian pointman and JI operations chief.
"Of course, Hambali, 39, may be lying about at least some of it," wrote Time�s Southeast Asian correspondent Simon Elegant from Kuala Lumpur. Prefaces to summaries of Hambali�s questioning warn he may be practicing "counter-interrogation techniques."
But two of his closest aides, Bashir bin Lap, alias Lillie, and Mohammed Farik bin Amin corroborated much of what Hambali said.
Hambali claims JI has been virtually "destroyed... because of those who had been captured." US: MILF Must Cut Terror Links
But, on Oct. 1, Ricciardone said the JI is known to have set up terrorist cells in MILF-controlled areas in Mindanao.
"The US will not provide economic development assistance in areas controlled by the MILF if that organization maintains ties to outlaws, terrorists, in violation of the written testimony of (deceased MILF) chairman (Hashim) Salamat in his last days," the envoy said last week.
Before his death in July, Salamat wrote a letter to US President George W. Bush expressing the MILF�s commitment to peacefully resolve their 35-year rebellion, Ricciardone said.
Ricciardone said Washington was "particularly concerned about the continuing presence in Mindanao of JI, which has been blamed for the October (2002) bombing in Bali, Indonesia that left more than 200 people dead."
However, the MILF�s Jaafar said in an interview with a Cotabato City radio station that Ricciardone�s pronouncement was only meant to "intimidate" the MILF and "pressure it to accelerate its forging of a final peace pact with the government."
Peace negotiations between the government and the MILF have been revived under the auspices of the Malaysian government and talks are set to restart in Kuala Lumpur sometime this month.
"There can be no other way we can interpret the circulation of these recycled stories ... that the MILF has links with al-Qaeda and the Jemaah Islamiyah," Jaafar told Catholic radio station dxMS.
Jaafar said Salamat, who died on July 13, was not the only one to disavow any link to terrorist organizations.
MILF chairman Ebrahim Murad, who succeeded Salamat, also issued a statement announcing that the MILF central committee has rejected terrorism.
"We will welcome an investigation on our alleged links with the Jemaah Islamiyah and al-Qaeda. Surely, investigators will find nothing," Jaafar said. - Time Asia, AFP, John Unson

NATIONALITY Born in Indonesia, ethnically Sudanese
Indonesian-born Riduan bin Isomuddin -- best known among extremists as Hambali -- was an operational mastermind in the Southeast Asia-based Islamic extremist group Jemaah Islamiya (JI) and also served as the main interface between JI and al-Qa'ida from 2000 until his capture in 2003. Hambali helped plan the first Bali bombings in 2002 that killed more than 200 persons and facilitated al-Qa'ida financing for the Jakarta Marriott Hotel bombing the following year. In late 2002, he also directed his subordinates Lillie and Zubair to case the British High Commission in Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Hambali was previously involved in the attempted assassination of the Philippine Ambassador to Indonesia in August 2000 and the bombings on Christmas Eve that year of some 30 churches across the archipelago. Hambali had longstanding ties to al-Qa'ida external operations chief Khalid Shaykh Muhammad (KSM). Before returning to Southeast Asia in December 2001, Hambali discussed operations with senior al-Qa'ida leaders regarding post-11 September attacks against US interests.
Hambali in 1999 established a cell of young JI operatives in Karachi, Pakistan -- dubbed al-Ghuraba -- which provided its members with advanced doctrinal and operational training, including at al-Qa'ida training camps in Afghanistan. Hambali tapped his younger brother, Rusman "Gun Gun" Gunawan, as deputy Ghuraba cell leader.
Hambali was born on 4 April 1964 in Cianjur, West Java, and is the eldest male of 11 children. His great-grandfather founded a local Islamic school, which Hambali attended during his early adolescence. Hambali was a devout Muslim youth who, at age 20, left Indonesia for Malaysia. ostensibly to seek work. While there, he met JI co-founder Abdullah Sungkar and Abu Bakar Bashir -- fellow Indonesians who had fled the Suharto regime for Malaysia -- and through them was exposed to radical Islamic teachings. Hambali tried unsuccessfully to get a scholarship to an Islamic school in Malaysia, before traveling in the mid-1980s to Afghanistan, where he fought alongside many of al-Qa'ida's future leaders. During his three-year stint in Afghanistan, he forged strong ties to Usama Bin Ladin and KSM. After returning to Malaysia in the early I 990s, Hambali and JI spiritual leader Bashir further developed their relationship and became close friends.

2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks - Wikipedia, the ... ... and on August 25, 2011, Israel ... and so far no group took responsibility for the attacks. The Israeli ... first reported as a suicide bomb attack, ... Site of the attacks
Deaths
6 Israeli civilians, 1 Israeli soldier, 1 Israeli Yamam policeman, 5 Egyptian soldiers, 10 attackers [2]
Non-fatal injuries
Perpetrators
Presumably 12 assailants. Israel has stated that the attacks were orchestrated by the Gaza based Popular Resistance Committees , who deny involvement. [4] Egyptian sources report that three of the attackers were Sinai-based Egyptians. [2] [5]
On August 18, 2011, a series of cross-border attacks with parallel attacks and mutual cover was carried out in southern Israel on Highway 12 near the Egyptian border by a squad of presumably 12 militants in four groups. [2] The attacks occurred after Israel's interior security service Shin Bet had warned of an attack by militants in the region and Israeli troops had been stationed in the area. [6] The militants first opened fire at an Egged No. 392 bus as it was traveling on Highway 12 in the Negev near Eilat . [3] [7] Several minutes later, a bomb was detonated next to an Israeli army patrol along Israel's border with Egypt. In a third attack, an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians. [8] Eight Israelis – six civilians, one Yamam special unit police sniper and one Golani Brigade soldier—were killed in the multiple-stage attack. [9] [10] The Israel Defense Forces reported eight attackers killed, and Egyptian security forces reported killing another two. [2]
Five Egyptian soldiers were also killed. According to Egypt, they were killed by Israeli security forces chasing militants across the Egyptian border, while an Israeli military officer initially said they were killed by a suicide bomber who had fled across the border into Egypt. [11] The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between Egypt and Israel and led to mass protests outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo. According to media reports, Egypt threatened to withdraw its ambassador to Israel, but Egypt's foreign minister later denied this. [2] Israel expressed regret over the deaths, and sent a letter of apology to Egypt. [12] The IDF was ordered to conduct a military probe of the incident, [13] [14] and on August 25, 2011, Israel agreed to a joint investigation with Egypt of the events. [15]
The identity of the attackers, three of whom were reportedly Egyptian, [16] is not widely agreed upon, [17] and so far no group took responsibility for the attacks. The Israeli government accused the Palestinian Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), a Gaza -based coalition of Palestinian militant groups, of orchestrating the attacks, [18] but the PRC denies involvement. [19] However, Israel attacked seven targets in the Gaza Strip immediately after the terror attacks in the Negev, killing five members of the PRC, including its leader. [20]
On August 21, 2011, an informal ceasefire was called by Israel and Hamas after days of escalating violence in which fifteen Palestinians were killed and many were wounded. More than 100 rockets and mortar shells were fired from Gaza into Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding more than a dozen. [21] The ceasefire was broken almost immediately by rocket fire from Gaza on southern Israel, followed by retaliatory Israeli airstrikes, killing at least seven Palestinians, among them two leaders of the Islamic Jihad . On August 26, 2011, Gaza militants called a second truce. [22] On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , Zuhir al-Qaisi , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks. [23]

Egypt–Israel border north of Eilat near where the attacks took place. Egypt is on the left, Israel on the right.
The southern part of Israeli Highway 12 runs adjacent to Israel's border with Egypt. It was the scene of previous shooting attacks in the 1990s.[ citation needed ] In the late 2000s, the Israeli government decided to build the Israel–Egypt barrier , although by 2011 only 10% of it had been completed, none close to the site of the attack. [24]
Following the 2011 Egyptian revolution militant organizations increased their activity in the Sinai Peninsula and Al-Qaeda militants groups were established, [25] after Egyptian police had all but completely withdrawn from the northern Sinai, dominated by Bedouin tribes. During the months preceding the cross-border attacks, Egypt reinforced its forces with about 1,000 additional soldiers in the Sinai Peninsula, with the consent of Israel, after a series of five bombings had disrupted the flow of natural gas to Israel. [26]
On July 30, militants staged an attack on an Egyptian police station in El-Arish, killing six. [27]
On August 2, a group claiming to be the Sinai wing of Al Qaeda declared its intention to create an Islamic caliphate in the Sinai. [28]
On August 14, 2011, Egyptian forces swept the Sinai Peninsula in search of terror cells. [29] Jordanian intelligence informed the Israelis that they had information about an impending terror attack in the south of Israel. [30] Two days prior to the attack, the Egyptian army captured four Islamist insurgents as they prepared to blow up a gas pipeline in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula. [31]
Israeli interior security service Shin Bet had warned of terrorist attacks being planned in the region in an area 80 kilometers long, presuming that they would take place at night. The warnings led to a massive deployment of IDF troops, [6] and the closing of Highway 12, which was reopened only on the day of the attack at the order of head of IDF's southern command Tal Russo . [32]
August 18 cross-border attacks and immediate Israeli response[ edit ]
The original attacks occurred in three coordinated stages. [8] They were carried out by 12 militants in four groups dispersed over an area 12 kilometers long. At least some of the attackers wore brown uniforms, similar to those used by the Egyptian Army . [2] Israeli military and police forces, in cooperation with Shin Bet , began pursuing the perpetrators immediately after the attacks commenced and locked down the area. [33]
The attacks commenced around 12:00 pm (UTC+2) near the Ein Netafim spring, on Highway 12 from Mitzpe Ramon to Eilat , when three militants spread out about 200 meters from one another, [10] armed with suicide bomb vests, grenades , RPGs , and machine guns opened fire on an Egged passenger bus on line 392, carrying mostly soldiers but also some civilians. [8] Seven passengers were wounded, most of them soldiers. [34] According to eyewitnesses, a white car was following the bus, and a group of people dressed in military uniforms got out and opened fire. The bus driver, Benny Belevsky, did not stop the bus and sped away, getting to an IDF post near the Netafim Border Crossing . [35]
The militants, dressed in brown uniforms resembling those of the Egyptian Army, then began attacking passing vehicles, waving white handkerchiefs to fool motorists. [2] One of the militants attacked a bus that drove by and detonated the suicide bomb belt he was wearing, killing himself and the bus driver, who had stopped the empty bus. [34] Another militant opened fire at a passing car and killed the female driver. The same militant then fired an RPG at an Israeli Air Force helicopter, but missed. An IDF jeep from the Golani Brigade then arrived at the scene and ran over the militant, killing him. [10] Another Golani Brigade jeep arrived, and ran over a roadside bomb. As the soldiers exited the damaged vehicle, the surviving militant opened fire at them. Soldiers and Yamam special police officers then located the militant and killed him in a gunbattle. Two other militants then opened fire at the from Egyptian territory. Israeli forces briefly crossed the border and killed both of the militants. One Israeli soldier was killed by friendly fire during the engagement and several soldiers were wounded. [36] [37] [38] [39] The Egyptian Army informed the IDF that its soldiers killed two more militants in the Sinai. [10]
In the third attack, which occurred around 12:35, mortar shells were fired at soldiers carrying out routine maintenance work at the security fence constructed along the border between Israel and Egypt. No one was hurt in the attack. [33] [40]
Around 13:30, not far from the first shooting incident, militants opened fire, including with an anti-tank missile , at a bus and private car on route 90, a desert road near the border with Jordan . According to medics, five people were killed in the attacks. [7] Seven people were wounded when another private vehicle was hit by an anti-tank missile. Eyewitnesses suggested that some of the attackers may have been wearing Egyptian Army uniforms. [41] Two IAF helicopters were called to the scene in order to evacuate those wounded.
IDF medic Anastasia Bagdalov was awarded military commendation for her response to the attack. She was a passenger on the bus that was attacked by militants. Begdlov used her bra as a tourniquet on a severely wounded passenger's artery.
Around 18:30, an Israeli patrol was fired on from the Egyptian border as it searched for militants. Israeli troops returned fire, and the shooting lasted for about an hour. A sniper from the Yamam special police unit was critically wounded and later died. News of the firefight interrupted a briefing by the Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Chief of Staff Benny Gantz . [42] [43] [44]
According to an Egyptian probe, Israeli troops entered the Sinai Peninsula chasing after the terrorists, exchanging fire with Egyptian police, and an Israeli helicopter fired two rockets at the terrorists and machine guns at Egyptian security personnel, killing an Egyptian officer and two policemen. [2] In a later incident, first reported as a suicide bomb attack, [45] another two Egyptian soldiers were killed, presumably also by Israeli forces. [2] Some Israeli sources claimed that an IDF investigation said that the IDF's attack helicopters avoided hitting the Egyptian military and that it remains unclear who fired the deadly shots. [46]
The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries and lead to mass protests in Cairo outside the Israeli embassy. [47]
Following the attack, all roads to and from Eilat were sealed off and operations at Ovda Airport were suspended. Roadblocks were set up at the entrance to the city of Eilat, and the area was locked down. Magen David Adom (Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service) raised its alert level and began preparing teams of paramedics and medical equipment. The Israeli Air Force sent in Eilat police deployed a large number of security forces and a police war room was opened at the Yoseftal Medical Center . Seven of the 29 injured people who were brought to the Yoseftal Medical Center were later transferred to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba . [30] The police asked the public to expect roadblocks at the entrance to Eilat amidst a heavy police presence in the city; however later in the day they added that no security incidents were under way in either Eilat or Beersheba despite calling for public vigilance and for the public-at-large to contact police in case of any suspicious individuals or items.

According to SITE a group calling itself Ansar Jerusalem claimed responsibility for the attack. [61] Nevertheless, Israel stated that it possesses evidence that indicate that the attacks were orchestrated by the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) in Gaza. [7] [62]
The (PRC) denied any involvement in the attack, though they praised it. According to PRC spokesman, "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems ". [63] According to Haaretz, there is doubt in Gaza, that members of the Popular Resistance Committees were behind the attack. The Egyptian daily Al-Masry Al-Youm reported that Egyptian security forces identified three of those responsible for the attack as Egyptians. [64]
Hamas, which governs Gaza, also denied involvement. [65] Sky News quoted Hamas spokesman Taher al-Nunu as saying: "The Palestinian government denies the accusations made by Barak about the operation in Eilat and affirms that there is no relation between the Gaza Strip and what happened near Eilat." [66] Hamas did, however, "praise" the attack. [67]
The Washington Times reported that US intelligence agencies linked Al Qaeda to the attack, claiming that either the PRC or the Gaza-based Jaish al Islam carried out the attacks. [68]
August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids
Casualties and losses None 14 Palestinians killed including at least 6 senior PRC militants; "scores" injured [69] [70]
At 18.00 the Israeli Air Force , [71] working with Shin Bet , [7] bombed a building used by Popular Resistance Committees' members in Rafah . Five PRC members were killed. Among the dead was the PRC's commander Kamal al-Nairab and military chief Immad Hammad, [72] [73] [74] who was suspected by Shin Bet of having planned the attacks. Of the remaining three, two were top members. [7] The two-year-old son of one of the militants, who was in the building when it was attacked, was also killed. [72] The airstrike occurred in the southern Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border. [75] [76] The PRC responded to the attack in saying that it vows "double" revenge. [7] Later, the Israeli Air Force launched a wave of attacks against targets in Gaza. A home near the former Palestinian intelligence headquarters was hit, reportedly killing one and wounding seventeen, and starting a large fire in the area. Israeli aircraft fired three missiles at a building used by Hamas security forces, and bombed a Hamas outpost in Khan Yunis . A missile was also fired at an open area in the southern Gaza Strip. Several targets were bombed in the northern Gaza Strip, including a building used by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades . Several targets were hit around the Philadelphi Route , believed to have been smuggling tunnels. [77] Numerous rocket-launching cells were attacked during the airstrikes. Three Palestinian militants were killed as they participated in the firing of rockets, and senior PRC member Samed Abdul Mu'ty Abed was killed while riding a motorcycle in northern Gaza. Another man was injured in the attack that killed Abed. [21] [78] [79]
The Israeli Air Force bombed two tunnels and one warehouse used for manufacturing weapons in southern Gaza and one site used for militant activities. The tunnels had been used to allow assailants to infiltrate Israel and carry out attacks according to a statement released by the IDF Spokesperson's Unit . The IAF identified direct hits, and all aircraft returned to Israel safely. [80] An airstrike in central Gaza targeting a car killed a Palestinian militant, his five-year-old son, and his brother. [73] [81]
On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed Zuhir al-Qaisi , the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks, and his collaborator, Mahmoud Hanani. [23]
Palestinian militant response to Israeli air strikes[ edit ]
After the Israeli Air Force attacked targets in the Gaza Strip, at least 10 rockets were fired into southern Israel, hitting the cities of Ashkelon and Beersheba , causing no injuries. [82] Two additional rockets landed in a courtyard of a Yeshiva in Ashdod , wounding 10 people and lightly damaging the buildings. [83] [84] The Abdullah Azzam Shaheed Brigade , a radical Islamic group affiliated with Al Qaeda , claimed responsibility for the attack. [85]
August 21st rocket attacks
Perpetrators
Over 80 rockets launched from Gaza hit cities in Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding over a dozen. [88] Seven rockets were fired almost simultaneously at Beersheba . The Iron Dome rocket defense system intercepted five of them, but one hit a residential area and killed Israeli Yossi Shushan. The Lachish subdistrict was hit by 28 rockets and the Negev subdistrict was hit by nine rockets. Four Israelis from the Bnei Shimon Regional Council were injured while running for shelter in Beersheba. Three Palestinians working in Israel were injured by Grad rockets after they exploded in a field in southern Ashdod . Vehicles and homes were damaged by rockets in Israeli cities near Gaza. [89] [90]
A Grad rocket exploded near the coastal city of Ashkelon in the night, though no injuries or damage were reported. It was unknown whether the rocket was intercepted by the Iron Dome , though it was confirmed that a second rocket was intercepted. [91] On August 21, an additional 12 rockets were fired at Israel. Three were intercepted by the Iron Dome in Ashkelon. One of the rockets hit an empty high school building in Beersheba. No one was in the school because "the city had canceled educational activities in light of the missile attacks that Palestinians in Gaza have been launching against the south in the last few days" according to Beersheba deputy mayor Heftziba Zohar. Later that night, a rocket killed a dog. [92] [93] [94]
Barrages of rockets were fired at Beersheba and Ashkelon. Half of them were intercepted by the Iron Dome . Mortar shells fired at farmland in the Eshkol Regional Council contained phosphorus , which is designed to create a more intense fire after detonation. [95] 40 rockets were fired on Sunday. [96] Several structures were damaged and a car caught fire after two rockets were fired at Ashkelon. A three-month-old infant was injured by glass splinters. [97]
A 13-year-old Palestinian boy, Mahmoud Abu Samra, was killed during the rocket attacks when a Palestinian Grad rocket fell short and landed in Gaza. [81]
An informal ceasefire was agreed upon between Israel and Hamas after the Arab League held an "urgent meeting" in Cairo on August 21, 2011. [98] Some 20 minutes after the ceasefire came into effect, a barrage of Qassam rockets and mortar shells was fired at Israel. The Iron Dome intercepted two rockets fired at Ashkelon. The Israeli Air Force attacked a militant cell in the northern Gaza Strip, wounding several people. The Islamic Jihad Movement and the Popular Resistance Committees said that they would not accept a ceasefire. [99]
On August 23, four Qassam rockets were fired at Israel in breach of the ceasefire. The rockets landed in open areas and caused no casualties, but one caused a brushfire which spread to an area near two civilian communities and threatened local greenhouses . Firefighters managed to contain the blaze before it did any damage. [100]
On August 24, more than 20 rockets were fired at Israeli communities. Grad rockets targeted the cities of Beersheba, Ashkelon, and Ofakim , injuring a nine-month-old baby. In Gaza, a senior Islamic Jihad member who funded the cross-border attacks was killed and two others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a car. Israeli jets also fired at two militants after they were seen preparing to fire rockets. Several hours after the strike, two mortar shells landed in the western Negev, causing no casualties. [101] Seven rockets were fired at Southern Israel, causing no damage or casualties. The Israeli Air Force attacked an Islamic Jihad rocket-launching cell, killing one militant. According to Palestinian media, the IDF fired shells at a militant squad in eastern Gaza after a rocket attack, but the cell escaped the strike. [102] On August 25, the Islamic Jihad Movement announced that it would abide by the ceasefire. The same day, 15 rockets and mortar shells hit Southern Israel, hitting open areas near Ashkelon and in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council . A mortar shell heavily damaged the Erez Crossing Terminal . Israel responded with airstrikes on several targets in the Gaza Strip. The two Islamic Jihad militants who had launched the mortar attack on the Erez Crossing were killed by an airstrike as traveled on their motorbike in northern Gaza. [103] On August 26, two Qassam rockets hit open areas in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council , and a Grad rocket exploded near Ashkelon. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility. [104]
On August 21, 2011, media reported that the Egyptian authorities were recalling the Egyptian ambassador in Israel in response to the killing of five Egyptian security officers by Israeli soldiers after the attacks near Eilat. [105] Egypt's foreign minister later stated that "at no point was there any intention on our part to recall our ambassador to Tel Aviv." [57]
Following the media reports about the killing of the Egyptian security officers, demonstrations against Israel erupted in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy. The demonstrators threw fire crackers at the building, unfurled a Palestinian flag, and called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in response to the killings. [11] Eventually a young Egyptian, Ahmed Al-Shahhat , climbed to the roof of the apartment building which houses the Israeli Embassy and removed the Israeli flag, replacing it with an Egyptian flag he had carried with him, becoming an instant folk hero in Egypt. The Israeli flag he had taken down was burned by protesters. [106] During the demonstrations which continued for several days, thousands of protesters, shouting anti Israel slogans, called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador, the recalling of Egyptian ambassador to Israel, a review of the Camp David Accords and the opening of the border with the Gaza Strip. [26] [107] On Friday, August 26, 2011, a demonstration announced as "Million-man demonstration to expel the Israeli ambassador" took place in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy, [108] drawing a few hundred protesters according to Haaretz . [109]
Israeli apology to Egypt[ edit ]
In October 2011, the New York Times reported that Israel had sent a letter of apology to Egypt for the killing of the Egyptian security officers by Israeli forces. [12]
 Israel:
President Shimon Peres said "The series of severe terror events are an attempt by terror organizations to murder innocent civilians within Israel, and to disrupt our lives" [110]
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that this was a "serious incident in which Israeli citizens were hurt and the country's sovereignty was harmed." [111] [112]
Defense Minister Ehud Barak stated "this is a grave terrorist incident in a number of locations. The incident reflects the weakness of Egypt's hold over Sinai and the spread of terrorist elements." [113] He also blamed the attacks on Gazans and pledged that Israel will respond. "The source of the terror incidents is Gaza and we will act against them with all our strength and determination." [114] He also expressed regret over the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers and ordered the IDF to conduct a military probe of the incident, and defense officials said it would likely be a joint probe with the participation of the Egyptian military. [13]
Palestinian Authority Chief-negotiator Saeb Erekat stated "Israel stands warned of any possible aggressive action or collective punishment measures against the Palestinian population in Gaza." Erekat stated that the Palestinian Authority is "against violence in all its forms," however, he added that such attacks should not be used by Israel as "a pretext for aggression."
Hamas denied responsibility for the attacks but praised the attacks "...since they were against soldiers." [115] Hamas warned Israel not to attack the Gaza Strip, following a statement by Defense Minister Ehud Barak that the IDF would strike back at the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza following a deadly triple terror attack. Hamas evacuated its command centers and sent senior commanders into hiding in anticipation of an IDF response. [116]
Popular Resistance Committee (PRC) spokesperson praised the attacks but said his group does not take any responsibility for launching it: "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems." [117]
Tawheed and Jihad , an al-Qaeda -linked group in the Gaza Strip, praised the attacks and said the "Jewish state should expect more." Over the internet, the group said "We in the Tawheed and Jihad group bless these blessed arms that pounded the fortifications of the vendetta-filled Jewish enemy in the so-called Eilat area in southern occupied Palestine." [118] [119]
Supranational
 United Nations – UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday strongly condemned the attack but called for restraint. According to a UN statement, "the secretary-general hopes that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and brought to justice. He is concerned at the risk of escalation and calls for all to act with restraint." [121]
 European Union – EU Chief Catherine Ashton condemned the attacks, and said "I have learned with deep concern of the series of terrorist attacks that has taken place in Southern Israel today, including against civilian targets, and in which several Israelis are reported to have lost their lives and many more to have been injured. I condemn unreservedly all such acts of terror, extend my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in these attacks and express my wishes for a full and speedy recovery to the injured." [122] [123]
The Middle East Quartet in a joint statement condemned the attacks and expressed concern "about the unsustainable situation in Gaza as well as the risk of escalation", and called for "restraint from all sides". [120]
International
 Bulgaria – The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks, saying: "We express our sincere condolences to the relatives of all victims. We are convinced that violence and terrorism cannot bring peace to the Middle East. Such acts do not help the efforts of the international community to bring the participants in the Middle East peace process back to the negotiations table." [124]
 Canada – Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird condemned the attacks, saying: “Canada condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in southern Israel today. These cowardly attacks, particularly on civilian targets, are abhorrent and criminal. On behalf of all Canadians, I send my heartfelt condolences to those affected by today’s vicious attacks.” Furthermore, Baird said: "“Israel has a right to defend itself against such terrorist acts in conformity with international humanitarian law. Those responsible for these horrific attacks must be held accountable.” [125]
 Costa Rica – The Ministry of Foreign Relations published an article condemning the attack, communicating its condolences to the people of Israel, specially to the victims and families of the murdered. The article stated that Costa Rica, as a peace loving country, respectful of all human rights, expresses its most energetic disapproval of any kind of violence or terrorist attacks, regardless of the motives behind it. [126]
 Germany – Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also condemned the attacks saying: "At this difficult hour we stand by the side of our Israeli friends. Those responsible must be prosecuted. Terror and violence must not be allowed to torpedo peace and negotiation efforts in the Middle East." [127]
 Italy – Italian Foreign Affairs Minister, Franco Frattini, condemned the "barbaric" attacks on southern Israel and warned the international community to prevent more such attacks due to the unrest in the Arab world. He said: "I would like to express my condolences and closeness to the Israeli people and government for the loss of life in the barbaric attacks today." [128]
 Netherlands – The Dutch Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms." [129]
 Norway – Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Gahr Støre "condemned in the strongest possible terms" the acts of terror, adding that Norway condemns all use of terror [130]
 United Kingdom – Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said that "I condemn these appalling and senseless acts of violence. As efforts for peace in the region continue, this brutality has no place, nor its perpetrators any excuse. My thoughts and prayers are with those killed and injured and I offer sincere condolences to their families and friends."
 USA – The State Department condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms," calling the attack "brutal and cowardly." Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said "We hope that those involved in the planning of these gruesome attacks will be brought to swift justice. We stand by Israel as our friend, partner, and ally – now and always." [131] She also added that "This violence only underscores our strong concerns about the security situation in the Sinai Peninsula. Recent commitments by the Egyptian government to address the security situation in the Sinai are important and we urge the Egyptian government to find a lasting resolution." [132]
 Russia – Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman by telephone. Lavrov expressed his condolences over the terrorist attacks in southern Israel. He condemned this extremist act, and "reaffirmed the immutable position of Russia that there can be no justification for terror or for those who use it as means to achieve their ends". He also said that "despite the gravity of the crime, it is necessary to exercise restraint and to avoid retaliatory steps from which innocent people may suffer". [133]
Following the attacks on Highway 12, Israel is reportedly to soon allow Egypt to deploy thousands of troops in the Sinai Peninsula in violation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, in which both countries agreed that the Sinai Peninsula will be a military-free zone. [15]
According to Haaretz, the IDF General Staff's investigation into the attack “was a source of great frustration”. An intelligence alert from the Shin Bet had led to a massive deployment of IDF troops in the area, but the forces' alertness had eroded, allowing the militants to track the IDF and choose their infiltration route. The decision not to close the road on the morning of the attack in spite of warnings from the Shin Beth is characterised as “understandable error of judgment, and definitely not a manifestation of carelessness”, whereas the appearance of the defense minister and the chief of staff at the scene of the incident while terrorists were still in the area is considered a serious security blunder that nearly culminated in another disaster.

This strictly summarises the content of the article below. [2]
Month
There were no Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel in January. [3]
February 26
Palestinians fired an M-75 medium-range rocket at the Israeli city of Ashkelon . The militant wing of Fatah , the party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas , claimed responsibility, calling the attack a response to the death [5] of Palestinian man Arafat Jaradat while in Israeli custody. The attack, which took place during an escalation of Palestinian violence against Israelis in the Fatah-controlled West Bank , was said to be the first of its kind since a 21 November 2012 truce and to have probably enjoyed the blessing of Hamas . Hamas denied that any rocket had been fired from the Gaza Strip. [6] [7] [8]
In March, Palestinians fired four rockets at Israel in one attack. [9]
March 21
Around 7:15 am, on the second day of a visit by US President Barack Obama in Israel, Palestinians in Beit Hanoun fired four rockets at the Israeli city of Sderot , triggering alarms in local communities and forcing residents on their way to work or school to run to bomb shelters. One rocket hit the backyard of a home in the city, spraying shrapnel into the walls and shattering windows. A second projectile landed in an open area within the surrounding Sha'ar Hanegev Regional Council . The two remaining rockets were believed to have landed within the Gaza Strip. No injuries were reported. [10] [11] [12] [13]
The Mujahedeen Shura Council , a Palestinian Salafi group, claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that it was meant to show that Israeli air defenses could not stop attacks on the Jewish state. "Responding to the bragging of the Roman dog and the war criminals of their so-called Iron Dome , we assert that all their military techniques will not stop God's destiny of tormenting them", the group posted on an Islamist website. [14]
On 2 April, police found what were apparently the remains of a third rocket in a kindergarten in Sderot. The rocket had not been located previously because the kindergarten had been closed for the Passover holiday. [15]
In April, Palestinians fired 17 rockets and 5 mortar shells at Israel in 13 separate attacks. Two of the rockets were fired from Egypt . [16]
April 2
Palestinians attempted to fire two mortar shells into Israel; both landed within the Gaza Strip. Later, in the evening, a third projectile was fired into the Eshkol Regional Council . No injuries or damage were reported. [17]
The Mujahedeen Shura Council claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying they were a response to the death of Palestinian man Maysara Abuhamdia that day while in Israeli custody. The 64-year-old Abuhamdia, who was serving a life sentence for his role in a foiled plot to blow up a busy Jerusalem cafe in 2002, died of throat cancer at the Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba , Israel. His death also sparked violence by Palestinians in East Jerusalem and the West Bank . [18] [19] [20]
Israel responded to the attacks with air strikes on two targets in the Gaza Strip that night, causing no injuries. [18] This was the first such strike since Operation Pillar of Defense . Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Yaalon said: "[W]e see Hamas as being responsible for everything that is fired from the Strip at Israel. We won't allow any routine involving a drizzle of rockets at our civilians and forces." [21]
April 3
Around 7:30 am, Palestinians fired two rockets at the Israeli city of Sderot . The rockets struck just as parents were dropping their children off at schools and kindergartens, triggering sirens and sending families fleeing for cover. No injuries or damage were reported. [21]
United Nations special envoy to the Middle East Robert Serry condemned the "indiscriminate firing of rockets into civilian areas" and also called on Israel to exercise restraint. [22] France said it "harshly condemns" the rocket fire on the "civilian population in south Israel". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said: "If the quiet is violated, we will respond strongly". [23]
The Mujahedeen Shura Council claimed responsibility for the attack. The group also alleged that the Palestinian Hamas regime in Gaza arrested two of its members in response. Hamas denied detaining the militants, saying: "Our security apparatus is part of the resistance [i.e., warfare against Israel] and does not arrest anyone who resists the occupation. On the contrary, we encourage resistance." [24] [25]
April 4
In the early morning, Palestinians fired a rocket and three mortar shells at Israel. The rocket landed in an open area in the Eshkol Regional Council at around 2 am, triggering alarms in nearby communities, while two of the mortars fell within the Gaza Strip. No injuries or damage were reported. [26] [27]
Israeli envoy to the UN Ron Prosor called on the United Nations Security Council to condemn the rocket attacks, writing: "The time has come for the Security Council to begin to worry for the safety of Israeli citizens as well". [28]
April 7
In the evening, as Israelis began observance of the annual Holocaust Remembrance Day and during a visit by US Secretary of State John Kerry in the region, Palestinians fired three rockets at Israel. One exploded in an open area in the Sha'ar Hanegev Regional Council . The other two were believed to have fallen within the Gaza Strip. No injuries or damage were reported. [29] [30]
Following the attack, Israel partially closed its border crossings with the Gaza Strip, while keeping the Erez crossing open for humanitarian passage. [31] Israel completely reopened the crossings on 12 April. [32]
April 17
Around 9 am, two 122 mm Grad rockets were fired at the Israeli resort city of Eilat on the Red Sea coast, triggering alarms. The rockets were believed to have been fired from Egypt 's adjacent Sinai Peninsula . One of the rockets exploded in a construction site in the residential neighborhood of Shahamon, while the other fell adjacent to the main hotel strip, near the Jordanian border. No physical injuries or damage were reported, but a number of residents suffered from acute stress reaction . The attack forced a temporary complete closure of Eilat Airport . An Iron Dome battery that had been stationed by the city did not intercept the rockets. Two rockets also landed in Jordan 's neighboring resort city of Aqaba . [33] [34] [35] [36]
The Mujahideen Shura Council claimed responsibility for the attack, saying they had targeted "occupied Eilat" [sic] as a "response to the continued suffering of the downtrodden prisoners in Israeli jails". [37]
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu said that Israel would respond to the attack, as was the country's consistent policy for the past four years. [38] [39]
April 18
Around 11 pm, Palestinians fired two rockets into the Eshkol Regional Council . No injuries or damage were reported. The Color Red alarm failed to sound. [40]
April 21
Before daybreak, Palestinians fired a rocket into the Eshkol Regional Council , triggering sirens in nearby towns and forcing residents into bomb shelters. No injuries or damage were reported. [41] [42]
April 27
On the evening of the Jewish Lag BaOmer holiday, Palestinians fired a rocket into the Sdot Negev Regional Council . The projectile exploded near a residential area but caused no injuries or damage. Israeli children who were celebrating the holiday with bonfires were instructed to return home. [43] [44]
Israel responded to the attack with air strikes on two sites in the southern Gaza Strip belonging to the militant wing of the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine : a training facility and a weapons storage site, causing no injuries. It also temporarily closed the Kerem Shalom border crossing between Israel and the Gaza Strip for commercial goods, keeping it open exclusively for humanitarian passage. The Israel Defense Forces stated that it "will not tolerate any attempt to harm Israeli civilians, and will not allow for a return to the reality before Pillar of Defense where Israeli civilians are threatened". [45] [46] [47]
April 29
Before daybreak, Palestinians fired a rocket into the Eshkol Regional Council . The projectile exploded in an open area and caused no injuries or damage. The Color Red alarm sounded in nearby communities. [48] [49]
April 30
The Palestinian Ansar Brigades claimed to have launched 5 mortar shells at the Israeli towns of Kerem Shalom and Holit (in the Eshkol Regional Council). No mortar hits were observed in Israel, however, and it was suggested that the projectiles all fell within the Gaza Strip. The Palestinian group said the attacks on the towns were a response to Israel's targeted killing of Haitham al-Mishal, a terrorist involved in the recent rocket attack on Eilat. "The occupation does not respect the truce nor fulfill its commitments," the group said in a statement. "The truce can go to hell." [50] [51]
In May, Palestinians carried out three attacks on Israel, firing 1 rocket and four mortars. [52]
May 2
In the evening, Palestinians fired two mortar shells into the Eshkol Regional Council . The projectiles landed in open areas, causing no injuries or damage. [53]
May 15
As Israelis celebrated the holiday of Shavuot , Palestinians fired a rocket into the Eshkol Regional Council, triggering the Color Red alarm. The projectile landed in an open area, causing no injuries or damage. The attack occurred as Palestinians marked Nakba Day and coincided with widespread Palestinian violence against Israelis in Jerusalem and the West Bank. [54] [55]
In a separate incident that took place in the morning, two mortar shells were fired from Syria at Mount Hermon in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights . The shells landed in open areas, causing no injuries or damage, but forcing a closure of the area to hikers for several hours. A previously unknown Palestinian Islamist group calling itself the Abdul Qader al-Husseini brigades claimed responsibility for the launchings, saying that its motive was "avenging all our martyrs that we lost in our war with the Zionist enemy". Mortar shells fired from Syria had landed in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights in several previous incidents, but all of these were presumed to be accidental fallout from the Syrian civil war . [56] [57]
In June, Palestinians launched 5 rockets at Israel in 3 separate attacks. [58]
June 19
Around 5:40 am, as world leaders were gathered in Jerusalem to celebrate the 90th birthday of Israeli President Shimon Peres , Palestinian terrorists fired one to three rockets toward the coastal city of Ashkelon , triggering sirens in the city and in surrounding communities. The rockets apparently landed within the Gaza Strip, and no injuries or damage were reported. [59] [60]
June 23/24
Overnight, Palestinians fired rockets at the city of Netivot , the Bnei Shimon Regional Council , and the Ashkelon Coast Regional Council . Two of the projectiles were intercepted by Iron Dome . Air raid sirens sounded as far as Beersheba , Rahat and Lahavim . No injuries or damage were reported. Palestinian Islamic Jihad was believed to be behind the attacks, and their motivation was thought to be internal tension in the Gaza Strip after an Islamic Jihad leader was killed by Hamas police the previous day.
Israel responded the same night with air strikes on two arms depots in the central Gaza Strip, a rocket launching site, and a terror activity site in the southern part of the Strip. It also temporarily closed the Kerem Shalom and Erez border crossings between Israel and Gaza for commercial passage. [61] [62] [63]
In July, Palestinians launched 5 rockets and 2 mortars at Israel in 6 separate attacks. Five of the rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip and two originated from the Sinai Peninsula in Egypt. [64]

Israel’s Secret Iran Attack Plan: Electronic Warfare - The ... Israel has electronic weapons that could be deployed if Israel attacks ... Israeli attack on hardened nuclear ... Begin might bomb the ... Israel has been building stealthy, multibillion-dollar electronic weapons that could be deployed if Israel attacks Iran's nuclear sites, U.S. intelligence officials tell Eli Lake.
For much of the last decade, as Iran methodically built its nuclear program, Israel has been assembling a multibillion-dollar array of high-tech weapons that would allow it to jam, blind, and deafen Tehran's defenses in the case of a pre-emptive aerial strike. 
A U.S. intelligence assessment this summer, described to The Daily Beast by current and former U.S. intelligence officials, concluded that any Israeli attack on hardened nuclear sites in Iran would go far beyond airstrikes from F-15 and F-16 fighter planes and likely include electronic warfare against Iran’s electric grid, Internet, cellphone network, and emergency frequencies for firemen and police officers. 
For example, Israel has developed a weapon capable of mimicking a maintenance cellphone signal that commands a cell network to “sleep,” effectively stopping transmissions, officials confirmed. The Israelis also have jammers capable of creating interference within Iran’s emergency frequencies for first responders. 
In a 2007 attack on a suspected nuclear site at al-Kibar, the Syrian military got a taste of this warfare when Israeli planes “spoofed” the country’s air-defense radars, at first making it appear that no jets were in the sky and then in an instant making the radar believe the sky was filled with hundreds of planes.
Israel also likely would exploit a vulnerability that U.S. officials detected two years ago in Iran's big-city electric grids, which are not “air-gapped”—meaning they are connected to the Internet and therefore vulnerable to a Stuxnet-style cyberattack —officials say. 
A highly secretive research lab attached to the U.S. joint staff and combatant commands, known as the Joint Warfare Analysis Center (JWAC), discovered the weakness in Iran’s electrical grid in 2009, according to one retired senior military intelligence officer. This source also said the Israelis have the capability to bring a denial-of-service attack to nodes of Iran’s command and control system that rely on the Internet.
Tony Decarbo, the executive officer for JWAC, declined comment for this story.  The likely delivery method for the electronic elements of this attack would be an unmanned aerial vehicle the size of a jumbo jet. An earlier version of the bird was called the Heron, the latest version is known as the Eitan. According to the Israeli press, the Eitan can fly for 20 straight hours and carry a payload of one ton. Another version of the drone, however, can fly up to 45 straight hours, according to U.S. and Israeli officials.  
Unmanned drones have been an integral part of U.S. wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Pakistan, gathering intelligence and firing missiles at suspected insurgents. But Israel's fleet has been specially fitted for electronic warfare, according to officials.
“They would have to take out radar and anti-aircraft. They could also attack with missiles and their drone fleet.”
The Eitans and Herons would also likely be working with a special Israeli air force unit known as the Sky Crows, which focuses only on electronic warfare. A 2010 piece in The Jerusalem Post quoted the commander of the electronic warfare unit as saying, “Our objective is to activate our systems and to disrupt and neutralize the enemy’s systems.”
Fred Fleitz, who left his post this year as a Republican senior staffer who focused on Iran at the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said in his meetings with Israeli defense and intelligence officials, they would always say all options were on the table. 
"I think Israel has the capabilities with their air force and mid-air refueling to take on these sites," said Fleitz, who is now managing editor of Lignet.com. "They would have to take out radar and anti-aircraft. They could also attack with missiles and their drone fleet." 
Whatever Israel ultimately decides to do about Iran’s program, one mission for now is clear. A senior Israeli official told The Daily Beast this month that one important objective of Israel's political strategy on Iran was to persuade Iranian decision makers that a military strike against their nuclear infrastructure was a very real possibility. "The only known way to stop a nuclear program is to have smashing sanctions with a credible military threat. Libya is the best example of this," this official said.
At the same time, if past practice is any guide, the Israelis would not likely strike at the same moment that their officials are discussing the prospect in the press. In other words, if Israel is openly discussing a military strike, it is unlikely to be imminent.
But if Israel goes radio silent—like it did in when it attacked a suspected nuclear site in Iraq in 1981—that may be an early warning sign that a strike is nearing.  
When Sam Lewis was U.S. ambassador to Israel during the transition from the Carter to Reagan administrations, he warned the new administration there was a chance then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin might bomb the Osirak nuclear reactor in Iraq.
“I had given a full alert to the new administration about the dangers,” Lewis recalled in an interview. “We’d been having discussions with the Israelis about how they wanted to stop the project, there was a lot of news and then it all dried up.”
Lewis and his staff had moved on. Then without warning on June 7, 1981, in something called Operation Opera, Israeli jets flew in late afternoon via Jordanian airspace and incinerated the nuclear facility that was under construction southeast of Baghdad. “I did feel after the fact that we should have assumed this bombing was going to take place,” Lewis said. “After it was over, I was not surprised, I was annoyed by having been misled by the quiet as it were.”
There may be a lesson for the Obama administration as it tries to calibrate what Israel will do on Iran. Since taking office, the president has made major efforts to avoid any surprises in the relationship with Israel, particularly on the issue of Iran. Obama and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, for example, tasked their first national security advisers to establish an unprecedented system for regular consultation between the two countries, featuring regular video-teleconferences.
They formed a standing committee on Iran as well, to check the progress of sanctions, share intelligence, and keep both sides informed. Despite all of this, Netanyahu has refused to give any assurance to Obama or his top cabinet advisers that he would inform or ask permission before launching an attack on Iran that would likely spur the Iranians to launch a terrorist attack on the United States or Israel in response, according to U.S. and Israeli officials familiar with these meetings. The Telegraph first reported the tension over the weekend .
Defense Secretary Leon Panetta "expressed the desire for consultation on any contemplated future Israeli military action, and [Ehud] Barak understood the U.S. position,” said one official familiar with the discussions.
The Israelis may be coy this time around because of the experience of then-Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert. In 2007, the Israelis presented what they considered to be rock-solid evidence that Syria was building a covert nuclear facility at al-Kibar. They asked President Bush to bomb the facility, according to the new memoir from Condoleezza Rice.
“The president decided against a strike and suggested a diplomatic course to the Israeli prime minister,” she wrote. “Ehud Olmert thanked us for our input but rejected our advice, and the Israelis then expertly did the job themselves.”
One American close to the current prime minister said, “When Netanyahu came into office, the understanding was they will not make the same mistake that Olmert made and ask for something the president might say no to. Better to ask forgiveness than to ask permission.”

Argentina
Argentina's continental area is between the Andes mountain range in the west and the Atlantic Ocean in the east. It borders Paraguay and Bolivia to the north, Brazil and Uruguay to the northeast, and Chile to the west and south. Argentine claims over Antarctica , as well as overlapping claims made by Chile and the United Kingdom , are suspended by the Antarctic Treaty of 1961. Argentina also claims the Falkland Islands ( Spanish : Islas Malvinas) and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands , which are administered by the United Kingdom as British Overseas Territories .
A recognised middle power , Argentina is Latin America's third-largest economy, with a "very high" rating on the Human development index . Within Latin America, Argentina has the fifth highest nominal GDP per capita and the highest in purchasing power terms . Analysts have argued that the country has a "foundation for future growth due to its market size, levels of foreign direct investment, and percentage of high-tech exports as share of total manufactured goods", and it is classed by investors as middle emerging economy . Argentina is a founding member of the United Nations, Mercosur , the Union of South American Nations , the Organization of Ibero-American States , the World Bank Group and the World Trade Organization , and is one of the G-15 and G-20 major economies .

Israeli military GAME CHANGER to combat IED attacks
Finally after many lives lost due to IED attacks the Israeli military has unveiled new technology to render IED useless. Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI), unveils its new CIMS (Counter IED and Mine Suite) - an integrated suite of sensors, for protection of tactical maneuvering vehicles. CIMS will be displayed at the 2014 Annual Association of the United States Army (AUSA) Meeting & Exposition in Washington DC, from October 13-15, 2014 (IAI North America - Booth #2039). Although mines and IEDs (Improvised Explosive Devices) are not new to the war scene, the use of these devices has become a matter of concern for modern armies both in regular and assymetric warfare. The CIMS suite was designed under the premise that no one sensor can provide the adequate probability of detection and low false-alarm rate required by today's operational needs. The CIMS suite detects both surface and underground IEDs, mines, and roadside bombs, and consists of an ADS - Above-surface Detection System, and MIDS - underground Mine and IED Detection System. The ADS includes a groundbreaking side-looking SAR radar, high-resolution optical detection system and an infrared multispectral investigation system. MIDS comprises a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) and a magnetic detector. Integration of the sensor suite through a central processing and management system delivers accurate synergetic real-time mapping of IED threats to the warfighter, requiring minimal training and decision-making. The CIMS suite and its subsystems can be adapted to any combat tactical vehicle. "CIMS was designed first and foremost to save lives," said Nissim Hadas, IAI VP & ELTA President. "Our combination of unique sensors allows a simple and highly effective mine and IED detection system to be provided to forward forces. We see huge potential for this system and consider it to be a groundbreaking solution." An improvised explosive device (IED) is a bomb constructed and deployed in ways other than in conventional military action. It may be constructed of conventional military explosives, such as an artillery round, attached to a detonating mechanism. Roadside bombs are a common use of IEDs. IEDs are generally seen in heavy terrorist actions or in unconventional warfare by guerrillas or commando forces in a theater of operations. In the second Iraq War, IEDs were used extensively against US-led invasion forces and by the end of 2007 they had become responsible for approximately 63% of coalition deaths in Iraq.[1] They are also used in Afghanistan by insurgent groups, and have caused over 66% of coalition casualties in the 2001–present Afghanistan War.[2] IEDs were also used extensively by cadres of the rebel Tamil Tiger (LTTE) organization against military targets in Sri Lanka.[3][4] Background The term Improvised Explosive Device comes from the British Army in the 1970s, after the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) used bombs made from agricultural fertilizer and semtex smuggled from Libya to make highly effective boobytrap devices or remote-controlled bombs. An IED is a bomb fabricated in an improvised manner incorporating destructive, lethal, noxious, pyrotechnic, or incendiary chemicals and designed to destroy or incapacitate personnel or vehicles. In some cases, IEDs are used to distract, disrupt, or delay an opposing force, facilitating another type of attack.[5] IEDs may incorporate military or commercially sourced explosives, and often combine both types, or they may otherwise be made with homemade explosives (HME). An IED has five components: a switch (activator), an initiator (fuse), container (body), charge (explosive), and a power source (battery). An IED designed for use against armoured targets such as personnel carriers or tanks will be designed for armour penetration, by using a shaped charge that creates an explosively formed penetrator. IEDs are extremely diverse in design, and may contain many types of initiators, detonators, penetrators, and explosive loads. Antipersonnel IEDs typically also contain fragmentation-generating objects such as nails, ball bearings or even small rocks to cause wounds at greater distances than blast-pressure alone could. IEDs are triggered by various methods, including remote control, infra-red or magnetic triggers, pressure-sensitive bars or trip wires (victim-operated). In some cases, multiple IEDs are wired together in a daisy-chain, to attack a convoy of vehicles spread out along a roadway. IEDs made by inexperienced designers or with substandard materials may fail to detonate, and in some cases actually detonate on either the maker or the emplacer of the device (these unintended early detonations are known as pre-detonations, "own goals", or "self-resolving bomb-tech removal" if the placer is killed in the detonation). Some groups, however, have been known to produce sophisticated devices that are constructed

If Israel could do this to a young American Jew, imagine what Palestinians face every day [MFV !]
MFV : [Make Facts Viral !] http://www.palestinenews1.org/#!home/mainPage The true face of the supposed "only democracy in the Middle East". A young American Jew quietly and calmly voices his opposition to Israel's policies towards the Palestinians, both in the occupied territories and in Israel itself, and is attacked by the Israeli police, who drag him along the road face down and throw him into a police van. American jewish boy roughly man handled and arrested in Jerusalem for sticking up for the Palestinians during jewish march. YouTube is deleting user accounts who have this video. I suggest people copy/download this video and spread it around themselves if my account is also deleted. ~~LET THE TRUTH BE KNOWN, SPREAD THIS VIDEO AROUND~~ Police violently arresting a Jewish teenager in Jerusalem for speaking the truth and charged him for "attacking and biting a police officer" !!! For one American Jewish teenager, this year's Jerusalem Day earlier this month turned out to be an event not to remember, as he was detained for two days on suspicion of attacking and biting a police officer. "Lucas," a 19 year-old from Philadelphia, cut a rather different figure in the Jerusalem Day flag parade in the capital. Like many participants in the event, he wore a skullcap on his head; unlike the others, however, a Palestinian flag and a keffiyeh were also part of his outfit. The youth, who arrived in Israel as part of a trip arranged by a Jewish-Christian group, claims he was attacked by a policeman during the celebrations. The parade turned ugly this year when a small group of participants walked through East Jerusalem, and the Old City's Muslim Quarter, chanting "death to Arabs." Lucas, with a few comrades, stood opposite these demonstrators, and shouted out slogans in support of ending Israel's occupation of the territories. He says that dozens of Palestinians gathered behind him, and formed a spontaneous protest. In a videotape, Lucas can be seen refusing to give policemen his passport, after he was apparently identified as the leader of the protest. After a few minutes, in the clip, a police officer is seen dragging Lucas forcibly into a police car, "Israel is occupying the Palestinian people in my name, in the name of world Jewry," Lucas, clutching his American passport, tells the camera. "And I myself, an American Jew, is here to say that is completely unjustified and ethically reprehensible. "And we, world Jewry and all people of the world, will not stop until this occupation ends and until the Palestinian people have their right - the right of return, the right to live without occupation, and equal rights within Israel. That is why we are here." Israel Police claims the young man attacked and bit an officer - however, the video does not show Lucas provoking any officers. It shows a group of policemen forcing him to the ground and handcuffing him; as a result, he required medical treatment afterward. For his part, Lucas adamantly denies that he attacked a police officer. "I didn't bite anyone," he says. "The police officer showed me his cuts [later], but they were caused by a sharp instrument, and there weren't any bite marks." Lucas was held in detention for two days. The Jerusalem Magistrate's Court denied a police request to extend his remand; at the advice of his lawyer and family, the youth left the country after being released.

Christopher Bollyn 2015 “Solving 911 Ends the War”
Christopher Bollyn 2015 “Solving 911 Ends the War” In the name of 9/11, “wars have been waged, governments overthrown, and an untold number of lives sacrificed.” Yet 9/11 is an unsolved crime of terrorism and mass murder, with no trial and no serious investigation. This elaborately planned criminal deception was carried out “with the intention that the public would be deceived with a false explanation blaming the atrocity on Osama Bin Laden and Al Quaida....” Christopher Bollyn states he has written “Solving 9-11: the Deception that Changed the World” because he could not remain indifferent and silent...”as the lies about 9/11 were used to wage wars of aggression and transform American into a police state.” An investigative journalist from Illinois, Bollyn sojourned in Europe and the Middle East before studying languages, history and journalism at UC Davis and Santa Cruz. His degree in history focused on the Israeli occupation of Palestine. He has written in-depth articles about the Middle East, electronic vote fraud, the dangers of depleted uranium, and the history and geo-political background of 9/11. In 2007, Bollyn and his family moved to Sweden when his research into 9/11 brought about his being attacked by undercover police and then charged with assaulting them. He began writing this book and has been touring in the US with the hope of raising the consciousness of the American public and exposing the true culprits. Readers of his book have said it is “the top-notch work of the 9/11 collection and ...the work of a brave genius...information we can use to reformulate our worldview....gives me hope that truth and liberty can ultimately prevail.” More information at www.bollyn.com. -- Tags: 911, Christopher Bollyn, Solving 911, Jewish Lightning, Sayanim, Agents, Assets -- Produced: 2015, Episode: CD-S911, 57:58, Category: Education -- Phone your local public TV station and ask them to broadcast this film to your local community.

[WW3] IRAN WARNS ISRAEL & US against ATTACK by flexing MILITARY MUSCLE in TEHRAN parade
TEHRAN: Iran warned Israel and the United States against any aggression, as it proudly paraded its troops and military hardware on Friday under the gaze of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and top brass. The Tehran parade, involving thousands of military personnel, dozens of tanks and missiles borne on trucks, marked the anniversary of the start of the 1980-1988 Iran-Iraq war. Ahmadinejad, in a speech broadcast on state television, said that Iran was using "the same spirit and belief in itself" shown in that war to "stand and defend its rights" today against pressure from world powers. Top Iranian generals said the show of military might should be digested by Israel, which in recent weeks has ramped up threats that it could hit Iranian nuclear facilities. "We do not feel threatened by the nonsense uttered by that regime's leaders," the chief of Iran's armed forces, General Hassan Firouzabadi, told the Fars news agency, adding that Iran's response to any attack would be "immediate and unstoppable." General Ataollah Selehi, the commander of Iran's army, told the ISNA news agency that "us holding a military parade is for deterrence and not a threat." He and other military leaders renewed their pledge that Israel would be annihilated if attacked. The head of the Revolutionary Guards' aerospace division in charge of missile defence, Brigadier General Amir Ali Hahjizadeh, repeated Iran's promise to close the strategic Strait of Hormuz if the Islamic republic were attacked or western sanctions halted its crude exports. "If one day the Strait of Hormuz has no benefit for us, then we will deprive others from benefiting from it," he said. However he added that "under current conditions, there is no problem." Hahjizadeh also dismissed navy war games currently being held by the United States and 30 other nations in the Gulf as "no threat to us." Iran is locked in a showdown with the UN Security Council over its controversial nuclear programme. Iran and the UN Security Council are locked in a showdown over Tehran's disputed nuclear programme. The west, led by the United States, has tightened the vice on Iran by implementing crippling economic sanctions, while Israel -- the Middle East's sole if undeclared nuclear weapons state -- has underlined its threats of possible air strikes on Iranian atomic facilities, with or without US help. In his speech, Ahmadinejad also touched on an anti-Islam film made in America by an extremist Christian group that has fuelled violent protests in parts of the Muslim world. He said US government claims it could do nothing to censor the film was a "deception" exploiting the pretext of freedom of expression. He called the film an Israeli-hatched plot "to divide (Muslims) and spark sectarian conflict." Ahmadinejad implicitly referred to his often expressed opinion that the Holocaust never happened to lambast the west for perceived selective censorship. "They stand against a question about a historical incident ... they threaten and put pressure on nations for posing the question while at the same time in regards to the obscenest insults to the human sanctities and prophets... they shout adherence to freedom (of expression)," he said. Ahmadinejad's stance challenging the facts surrounding the killing of six million Jews by the Nazi regime during World War II is shared by Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who is the country's commander-in-chief. Early this week, Khamenei told naval cadets: "In some western countries, no one dares to question the unknown incident of the Holocaust or for that matter some of the morally obscene policies like homosexuality ... but insulting Islam and its sanctities under the pretext of freedom of expression is allowed."

Those strikes, according to Israeli officials, targeted shipments of Iranian-made Fateh-110 missiles bound for Israel's arch foe — the Lebanese Hezbollah militant group.

Ezra Levant - Calgary Muslim pleads guilty to attacking Jewish girl
One of four pro-Palestinian protesters charged in connection with a dust up with Israel supporters in Calgary pleaded guilty to assault Wednesday for sucker-punching a woman. The offender, who was 17 at the time and can’t be named, admitted striking Samantha Hamilton once in the face as she went to assist her brother, who was being attacked. Defence counsel Rame Katrib entered a guilty plea on behalf of the now 18-year-old before youth court Judge Richard O’Gorman. Crown prosecutor Carla MacPhail, who said she will not be seeking any custody, read in a statement of agreed facts signed by Katrib and his client. She said the altercation took place during a rally by Palestine supporters outside the Municipal Building on Macleod Tr. S. in the early evening of July 18. “The protesters were chanting slogans, displaying Palestinian flags, pro-Palestinian signs and placards,” MacPhail said. “In view of the protesters, the Israeli military action in Gaza was unjustified and had resulted in the deaths of innocents, including women and children,” she said of the highly charged event. “During the protest, a group of approximately 15 people who are supporters of the Israeli government arrived,” MacPhail told O’Gorman. Hamilton, 22, and her brother Shane, 19, were part of the group of “counter-protesters,” the prosecutor said. A heated exchange ensued between people other than the youth and the Hamiltons which resulted in a pro-Palestinian grabbing an Israeli flag and stomping on it. MacPhail said many in the crowd took cell phone videos of the events. “These videos depict shouting ... which turned quickly into physical altercations,” she said. “At one point Shane Hamilton ... was on the ground being struck and kicked by a number of individuals,” said MacPhail, adding the young offender was not alleged to be involved in that assault. “As Samantha Hamilton went to her brother’s aid, she suffered one blow, a punch, to the front left side of her face which was delivered by (the teen),” she said. “She then felt another blow to the back of her head and had her hair pulled. “These were not delivered by (the teen).” MacPhail said the physical violence, which resulted in three adults also being charged, lasted less than two minutes. She said Calgary police were not in attendance as a previous protest by the Palestinian group had ended peacefully. A sentencing hearing is set for Jan. 26.

Sinai: Yom Kippur 1973 - Israeli tanks win the war with Arik Sharon.
(From "Greatest Tank Battles") Defeat seemed to be imminent for the state of Israel. The Syrians’ Soviet-style massive frontal assault was too much to bear, and the Israeli front lines had already collapsed. The Israeli general in charge of the entire front had abandoned his nearly surrounded headquarters (HQ) and retired to a makeshift command post a few kilometers back. With two Syrian brigades advancing on the headquarters and no Israeli reserves in sight, defending the headquarters–left in the hands of infantrymen supported by only two trackless tanks mustered from the camp’s repair depot–seemed almost futile. On October 6, 1973, during Yom Kippur, the holiest day of the Jewish calendar, a Syrian armored force of 1,400 tanks backed by more than 1,000 artillery pieces and supporting air power began a coordinated assault along the 36-mile-long Israeli-Syrian border in the Golan Heights in the north of Israel. That attack coincided with a similar onslaught by Egyptian forces along the Suez Canal, suddenly forcing Israel to fight a two-front war. This prompted Arik Sharon to launch Operation Abiray-Lev (Stouthearted Men) the next day, penetrating the Egyptian line of defense and crossing the Suez Canal.
