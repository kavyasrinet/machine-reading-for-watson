The U.S. military said it fired two Hellfire missiles just before 10 a.m. after spotting fighters in Sadr City with at least five rockets. Officials said another missile was fired a few minutes later at a black sedan near a rocket launch site. Ten people were killed and 22 wounded in Sadr City on Thursday and late Wednesday night, according to the Sadr office in the area, which did not specify how many people were killed in the airstrikes. [Washington Post, 4/11/08 ] APRIL 23, 2008. The Bush administration picked Gen. David Petraeus, its top commander in Iraq, on Wednesday to to lead Central Command, the military command responsible for all Middle East operations and chose his former No. 2 to take over in Baghdad. The decision to elevate both Petraeus and Lt. Gen. Raymond Odierno, who together implemented a new military strategy that drove violence down in Iraq, signals that Washington does not plan any major changes in its approach to that war. [Reuters, 4/23/08 ] APRIL 28, 2008. The latest episode in the struggle between the Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr and the Iraqi government unfolded Sunday on the streets of Sadr City, where members of Parliament demonstrated peacefully while clashes occurred a few blocks away. Several hours later, Shiite militiamen in the Sadr City district took advantage of a huge dust storm that enveloped Baghdad, and kept American aircraft grounded, to fire at least a dozen mortar rounds at the Green Zone, the home of the American Embassy and of many Iraqi government officials. [New York Times, 4/28/08 ] MAY 7, 2008. After months of stalled talks between the United States and Iran, the Iraqi government said it was time for the two nations to stop trading accusations and come to the table. Iraq's foreign minister, Hoshyar Zebari, said that his government had proposed four dates to the United States and Iran for tri-lateral talks, but has stopped making suggestions and doesn't expect the talks to resume anytime soon. [McClatchy, 5/7/08 ] MAY 12, 2008. Fighting ebbed and residents emerged from their homes as a deal to halt fighting took effect Sunday in Sadr City, the Baghdad slum that has been the focus of ongoing clashes pitting U.S. and Iraqi forces against militiamen loyal to radical Shiite Muslim cleric Muqtada Sadr. But after more than seven weeks of bloodshed, officials and residents alike were cautious about declaring the hostilities over. [LA Times, 5/12/08 ] MAY 13, 2008. Turkish war planes bombed Kurdish separatist PKK rebels in northern Iraq overnight but there were no casualties, a security spokesman for Iraq's Kurdistan region said on Monday. In a separate incident, the Iranian military shelled rebels from a different Kurdish faction that operate from Iraq's Kurdistan region on Sunday, Yawar said. There were also clashes on the Iraq-Iran border between those rebels and Iranian forces but no casualties, he said. [Reuters, 5/13/08 ] MAY 14, 2008. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki took personal charge Wednesday of a military operation to rout al-Qaida in Iraq from Mosul, in northern Iraq, which the U.S. has described as the terror group's last major stronghold. The campaign in Mosul was the third by al-Maliki in two months as he attempts to stamp out Shiite militants and Sunni extremists across the country. [New York Times, 5/14/08 ] MAY 14, 2008. A teenaged girl blew herself up outside an Iraqi army post south of Baghdad, killing one soldier, the U.S. military said. A military spokeswoman said the girl was between 16 and 18 years old. Seven Iraqi soldiers were also wounded in the attack, the military said. There have been regular attacks by female suicide bombers in recent months in Iraq, but nearly all have taken place north of Baghdad, in regions where Sunni Islamist al Qaeda fighters have regrouped. [Reuters, 5/14/08 ] June 10, 2008. A proposed U.S.-Iraqi security agreement that would set the conditions for a defense alliance and long-term U.S. troop presence appears increasingly in trouble, facing growing resistance from the Iraqi government and bipartisan opposition in Congress. President Bush is trying to finish the agreement before he leaves office, and senior U.S. officials insist publicly that the negotiations can be completed by a July 31 target date. The U.S. is apparently scaling back some of its demands, including backing off one that particularly incenses Iraqis, blanket immunity for private security contractors. [McClatchy, 6/10/08 ] JUNE 17, 2008. A car bomb explosion at a busy bus stop in northern Baghdad killed 51 people and left another 75 wounded. The explosion took place in the mainly Shia neighbourhood of Hurriya. [BBC, 6/17/08 ] JUNE 19, 2008. Iraqi security forces met little resistance in the southern city of Amarah as they sought to disarm gunmen loyal to Muqtada al-Sadr. Iraqi defense officials said there were no casualties or gun battles as military and national police units easily spread through northern Amarah, a mostly Shiite oil and agricultural city that borders Iran and for decades has served as a smuggling hub. [McClatchy, 6/19/08 ] JUNE 22, 2008. The latest in a wave of female suicide bombers killed 15 people and wounded more than 40 others on Sunday near a heavily fortified courthouse and government outpost in central Baquba, Iraqi security officials said. Seven of the dead and 10 of the wounded were Iraqi police officers. The bombing was the most devastating of four attacks by guerrillas in Diyala Province on Sunday that left at least 25 people dead and close to 60 wounded. [New York Times, 6/23/08 ] JULY 9, 2008. Iraq's national security adviser said Tuesday that his government would not sign an agreement governing the future role of U.S. troops in Iraq unless it includes a timetable for their withdrawal. The statement was the strongest demand yet by a senior Iraqi official for the two governments to set specific dates for the departure of U.S. forces. Speaking to reporters in the Shiite holy city of Najaf, National Security Adviser Mowaffak al-Rubaie said his government was 'impatiently waiting' for the complete withdrawal of U.S. troops. [Washington Post, 7/9/08 ] JULY 15, 2008. U.S.-led operations are having more success in Iraq than in Afghanistan, where a porous border with Pakistan has allowed Islamist extremists to cross into the war zone, President George W. Bush said on Tuesday. [Reuters, 7/15/08 ] JULY 15, 2008. Two suicide bombers killed 16 police recruits and wounded 30 others at a security post north of Baghdad on Tuesday, the U.S. military said. The attacks took place in Baquba, capital of Diyala province, where recruits were lining up. A police source said 20 people were killed and 55 wounded. [Reuters, 7/15/08 ] JULY 15, 2008. Iraq's parliament failed to approve a draft provincial elections law because of disagreement over what to do about voting in the disputed oil city of Kirkuk, lawmakers said. It was unclear when parliament would convene again to consider the draft, which has to be passed so the electoral commission can prepare for polls seen as vital to fostering national reconciliation. [Reuters, 7/15/08 ] JULY 16, 2008. Iraq hopes to have security control of all its provinces by the year-end, national security adviser Mowaffaq al-Rubaie said on Wednesday, underscoring the government's growing confidence in its own forces. Rubaie was speaking at a ceremony where U.S.-led troops transferred security responsibilities for the southern Shi'ite Qadisiya province to Iraqi forces. The handover puts Baghdad in control of security in 10 of the country's 18 provinces, all mainly Shi'ite or Kurdish areas. [Reuters, 7/16/08 ] JULY 17, 2008. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has for the first time since 2003 redeployed expatriate staff to Iraq, the United Nations agency said on Thursday. It said several international staff had quietly returned to Iraq in late June, reestablishing a 'permanent international basis' in the country after 5 years. U.N. agencies withdrew international staff after the deadly bombing of its Baghdad headquarters in August 2003, but Iraqi nationals continued their aid projects. The U.N. refugee agency recently sent back staff to Iraq. [Reuters, 7/17/08 ] JULY 18, 2008. Kuwait on Thursday named its first ambassador to Iraq since Saddam Hussein's forces invaded the oil-rich country in 1990 and set off the 1991 Persian Gulf War. The announcement came as Iraq's Shiite Muslim-led government is reaching out to its Sunni Arab neighbors in a bid to ease tensions and secure investment to rebuild the nation. [LA Times, 7/18/08 ] JULY 19, 2008. Iraq's largest Sunni bloc ended a nearly yearlong boycott Saturday and rejoined the cabinet, retaking six ministry spots. The Iraqi National Accord said they rejoined the government because the schism between the party and Maliki had diminished and that many of their demands had been met. [McClatchy, 7/19/08 ] JULY 22, 2008. Iraq's parliament passed a provincial elections bill, but a walkout by Kurdish lawmakers over how to deal with the disputed oil city of Kirkuk could mean the law will not be ratified by the presidency. Kurds make up one of three main groups, and their boycott of the vote means the bill could be sent back to parliament. The law is meant to pave the way for polls seen as vital to reconciling Iraq's Sunni Arabs, who boycotted the last provincial elections in 2005, with its other communities. [Reuters, 7/22/08 ] JULY 22, 2008. The U.S. troop 'surge' in Iraq that President George W. Bush ordered last year has ended after the last of five additional combat brigades left the country, a U.S. military spokesman said on Tuesday. The remaining troops from that brigade departed over the weekend, leaving just under 147,000 American soldiers in Iraq, the spokesman said. [Reuters, 7/22/08 ] July 24, 2008. Turkey's military said its fighter jets hit 13 Kurdish separatist targets in northern Iraq the previous day, but said it was still trying to confirm losses suffered by the rebels. Operations will continue against the separatist Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), the military said in a statement on its website. The PKK uses northern Iraq as a base from which to launch attacks on the Turkish military. [Reuters, 7/24/08 ] JULY 24, 2008. Iraq's Kurdish president Jalal Talibani vetoed legislation on provincial elections, sending it back to lawmakers for revisions as political leaders continued to try to strike a deal that would allow the vote to be held this year as planned. Provincial elections are seen as central to political progress in Iraq, but their timing was thrown into doubt when Kurdish lawmakers boycotted the parliamentary vote on the legislation, insisting that it be rewritten. [New York Times, 7/24/08 ] JULY 24, 2008. A female suicide bomber killed eight people and wounded more than 20 in Iraq, police have said. The woman detonated her explosives near a military patrol or checkpoint in the town of Baquba, a frequent flashpoint, security officials said. Those killed were reported to be local Sunni troops recruited to work with US and Iraqi forces. [BBC, 7/24/08 ] AUGUST 8, 2008. Muqtada al Sadr will disband the armed wing of his militia if a new Iraq-U.S. security agreement includes a date for an American withdrawal, a key Sadr aide said Friday. 'It depends on what this agreement brings us,' said Salah al Obaidi, a Sadr spokesman. 'When there is no more occupation, there will be no need for these cells.' The pronouncement could give Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki a potent incentive to press the United States for a specific withdrawal date. [McClatchy, 8/8/08 ] AUGUST 13, 2008. Bombs in four parts of northern Iraq killed at least six people, and Iraqi forces said they expected more attacks as they pursue Sunni Arab militants in the volatile north. The U.S. military said a suicide car bomber struck an Iraqi army patrol in the northern city of Mosul, killing an Iraqi soldier, two civilians and wounding 15 people. A parked car bomb in the town of Qaiyara south of Mosul killed two people and wounded nine. A roadside bomb near Baquba north of Baghdad killed a woman and wounded two. Another suicide car bomber struck the mayor's office in the small town of al-Motaqa near the ethnically divided city of Kirkuk. A U.S. soldier and an Iraqi interpreter were killed by a roadside bomb in Baghdad. [Reuters, 8/13/08 ] AUGUST 14, 2008. King Abdullah II of Jordan became the first Arab head of state to visit Iraq since Saddam Hussein's regime collapsed in 2003. Iraqi officials heralded the brief and previously unannounced visit as a sign that their Arab neighbors finally were shedding their fear of a government that they'd seen as religiously and ethnically divided. Iraq has been largely isolated from its mostly Sunni Muslim Arab neighbors as violence skyrocketed and the influence of Shiite Iran became more pronounced. [McClatchy, 8/11/08 ] AUGUST 25, 2008. Prime Minister Nouri al Maliki said Monday there would be no security agreement between the United States and Iraq without an unconditional timetable for withdrawal - a direct challenge to the Bush administration, which insists that the timing for troop departure would be based on conditions on the ground. 'No pact or an agreement should be set without being based on full sovereignty, national common interests, and no foreign soldier should remain on Iraqi land, and there should be a specific deadline and it should not be open,' Maliki told a meeting of tribal Sheikhs in Baghdad. [McClatchy, 8/25/08 ] AUGUST 26, 2008. At least 25 people were killed and 45 injured when a car bomber detonated his vehicle at a police recruitment center in Jalula, northeast of Baqouba in Diyala province, Iraqi police said. Posing as a security officer, the bomber drove up to a checkpoint in the mostly Kurdish town of where dozens of men were standing to register to join a new battalion in the security forces in Diyala province. When questioned, he detonated the car. [McClatchy, 8/26/08 ] AUGUST 27, 2008. Iraq's cabinet approved a $3 billion oil service contract with China, the government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said, in a move that could signal the shape of anticipated future oil deals. The Iraqi government recently announced renegotiated terms of an oil deal with the Chinese National Petroleum Company (CNPC), which was originally signed in 1997. The deal marks the first major oil contract with a foreign firm for Iraq, which boasts the world's third-largest proven reserves, since the fall of Saddam Hussein. [Reuters, 8/27/08 ] SEPTEMBER 1, 2008. Iraq takes control of Anbar province from U.S. The U.S. military turned over control of Iraq's Anbar province, once the country's most dangerous, to the Iraqi government Monday in a landmark step toward the withdrawal of more American troops. There have been signs of trouble in Anbar recently as local Sunni leaders have complained of being marginalized by the Shiite-led government in Baghdad. [USA Today, 9/1/08 ] SEPTEMBER 5, 2008. Al Qaeda remains a dangerous force in Iraq despite a general decline in violence and U.S. troops must continue to confront the militant group, the outgoing top U.S. general in the country said. General David Petraeus told al Arabiya television he believed recent success in reducing violence had restored the United States' image with Iraqis. Troops initially greeted as liberators but later viewed as occupiers were now again accepted as friends. [Reuters, 9/5/08 ] SEPTEMBER 5, 2008. Pentagon leaders have recommended to President Bush that the United States make no further troop reductions in Iraq this year, administration officials said yesterday. The plan, delivered this week, calls for extending a pause in drawdowns until late January or early February - after the Bush administration has left office. At that point, up to 7,500 of the approximately 146,000 troops in Iraq could be withdrawn, depending on conditions on the ground there. The reduction would coincide with new deployments to Afghanistan, officials said. [Washington Post, 9/5/08 ] SEPTEMBER 9, 2008. President Bush announced that about 8,000 US troops will be withdrawn from Iraq by February - with 4,500 being sent to Afghanistan. He argued that reduced violence levels in Iraq allowed for a 'quiet surge' of troops in Afghanistan. There are currently 146,000 US troops in Iraq and 33,000 in Afghanistan. [BBC, 9/9/08 ] SEPTEMBER 11, 2008. Iraq's defense minister said that his country was seeking to buy F-16 fighter jets from the United States, while his American counterpart, Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates, said he believed that the Iraq war had entered the 'endgame.' In Baghdad, the Iraqi defense minister, Abdel Qader Mohammed Jassim, said buying the jets would be a crucial step if Iraqi forces were to assume more responsibilities from American soldiers. Officials in Washington, however, said any possible sale was at a very preliminary stage. Two days ago Kurdish leaders warned that any sale of advanced weapons, including the F-16s, to the central government would have to include guarantees that they would not be used against the country's semi-autonomous Kurdish region in the north. [New York Times, 9/11/08 ] SEPTEMBER 12, 2008. At least 28 people were killed in a suicide car bombing in a town north of Baghdad, police say. The blast targeted a police station in the commercial district of the mainly Shia town of Dujail. At least 40 others were injured in the explosion, police said. [BBC, 9/12/08 ] SEPTEMBER 13, 2008. Eight Kurdish pesh merga soldiers were killed in a roadside bombing in a disputed part of eastern Diyala Province. Among the dead in the bombing, in the town of Khanaqin, was the senior pesh merga commander for the area, according to the local police chief, Col. Azad Issa. The bomb, which went off as the Kurdish force was patrolling, killed six people on the spot; the other two died after being taken to the hospital, Colonel Issa said. The Kurdish presence in Khanaqin, and in other nearby areas, has been a growing source of tension. Kurdish forces have been moving beyond the borders of their semiautonomous region in northern Iraq, in what they say is an effort to improve security. [New York Times, 9/13/08 ] SEPTEMBER 16, 2008. Odierno Succeeds Petraeus as Iraq Commander. United States military command in Iraq changed hands from Gen. David H. Petraeus, who created the strategy known as the surge, to Gen. Ray Odierno, who oversaw its day-to-day operations across a country in which violence has dropped significantly. In his first, brief comments as commander of the multinational forces in Iraq, General Odierno said, 'We must realize that these gains are fragile and reversible, and our work here is far from done.' [New York Times, 9/16/08 ] SEPTEMBER 17, 2008. Syria Appoints Ambassador to Iraq. September Syria announced Tuesday that it had appointed an ambassador to Iraq for the first time since the early 1980s. The ambassador, Nawaf Fares, was sworn in as the envoy before the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, the Syrian state news agency reported. The agency did not say when Mr. Fares, who served previously as governor of Quneitra Province, would go to Baghdad. Syria and Iraq, which had long traded accusations of interference, were ruled by rival branches of the Baath Party until the American invasion of 2003 toppled Saddam Hussein. Diplomatic relations were restored in 2006 but, like many Arab countries, Syria delayed sending an ambassador, citing the security situation in Baghdad. [New York Times, 9/17/08 ] OCTOBER 17, 2008. White House officials said the United States and Iraq are nearing an agreement on U.S. troops in Iraq and a schedule for their eventual departure. Aides to congressional members were briefed at the White House, while Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki briefed his national security council in Baghdad. The agreement must be reviewed by the Cabinet after being studied by the president's security council. After those two reviews, it must be approved by the Iraqi Parliament, where some members dislike the terms, particularly the immunity provisions for U.S. troops. [UPI, 10/17/08 ] OCTOBER 26, 2008. An official Syrian government source on Sunday announced that four US helicopters coming from Iraq violated the Syrian airspace, targeting a civilian building, killing eight citizens. Later, the US helicopters flew back to the Iraqi airspace. Syria, while condemning this act of aggression, holds the US forces responsible for this aggression and all of its repercussions, calls on the Iraqi government to shoulder its responsibilities and open an immediate investigation into this dangerous violation and prevent using the Iraqi territories for launching aggression on Syria. [Syrian Arab News Agency, 10/26/08 ] OCTOBER 27, 2008. Tensions between Kurdistan and the central government of Iraq over the status of Kirkuk. A parliamentary committee rejected a new draft of an oil law, and Kurdish politicians denounced the government's effort to create semi-tribal councils as a counterweight to Kurdish political power in Kirkuk. At issue are fundamental questions of territorial rights: redrawing the borders of the Kurdish region, the rights of that region versus those of the central government and, not least, the region's right to develop its own oil resources. [New York Times, 10/27/08 ] OCTOBER 27, 2008. A new Iraqi military offensive is under way in the still violent northern city of Mosul, but the worry is not only the insurgents who remain strong here. American commanders are increasingly concerned that Mosul could degenerate into a larger battleground over the fragile Iraqi state itself. The problems are old but risk spilling out violently here and now. The central government in Baghdad has sent troops to quell the insurgency here, while also aiming at what it sees as a central obstacle to both nationhood and its own power: the semiautonomous Kurdish region in the north and the Kurds' larger ambitions to expand areas under their control. [New York Times, 10/27/08 ] OCTOBER 28, 2008. U.S. officials said that a US helicopter raid into Syria killed a key figure involved in the smuggling of foreign fighters into Iraq. Officials called the raid, which they said killed Iraqi Abu Ghadiyah, a 'success'. The White House has neither confirmed nor denied the incident. Syria has condemned Sunday's attack as an act of 'terrorist aggression'. It says eight unarmed civilians were killed near Abu Kamal, about eight kilometres (five miles) inside Syria. If confirmed, this would be the first US attack in Syria since the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. [BBC, 10/28/08 ] OCTOBER 28, 2008. The Iraqi cabinet has decided to reopen negotiations on the status of forcess agreement, further delaying a pact that American officials had hoped to conclude by now. The call for changes in the proposed accord came as the government of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki criticized an attack by Iraq-based U.S. forces on alleged al-Qaeda operatives inside Syria last weekend. The cabinet now wants the agreement to include language to 'confirm that Iraqi land would not be the center for aggression' against its neighbors, said Planning Minister Ali Baban, who attended Tuesday's meeting. [Washington Post, 10/28/08 ] OCTOBER 28, 2008. An Iraqi judge Tuesday convicted an Iraqi man of abducting, torturing and killing two American soldiers in the summer of 2006. In the first case of its kind, Ibrahim Karim Muhammed Salih al-Qaraghuli was found guilty and sentenced to death after expert testimony that his fingerprints matched photos of bloody prints found on the front panel of the pickup truck used to drag the soldiers, Pfc. Kristian Menchaca and Pfc. Thomas L. Tucker. Citing lack of evidence, Judge Munther Raouf Haadi acquitted Qaraghuli's two co-defendants. The proceeding cast a spotlight on the Iraqi court system, which has come under scrutiny in recent weeks as Iraqi and American officials have argued over whether Iraq should have the right to prosecute U.S. soldiers under certain circumstances as part of a yet-to-be-signed agreement regarding the presence of American troops in Iraq after 2008. The case decided Tuesday was the first in which an Iraqi investigative judge filed charges in the slaying of U.S. soldiers. [Washington Post, 10/29/08 ] OCTOBER 29, 2008. US hands Wasit province to Iraqi forces. Iraqi authorities have taken over responsibility for security in another province from US military forces. Wasit, bordering Iran in the east of the country, is the 13th of Iraq's 18 provinces to be transferred. The transfer of Wasit took place at a ceremony in the provincial capital of Kut, south of Baghdad. [BBC, 10/29/08 ] NOVEMBER 7, 2008. Iraq Repeats Insistence on Fixed Withdrawal Date. Two days after the election of Barack Obama, Iraq's chief spokesman said with unusual forcefulness that his government will continue to insist on a firm withdrawal date for U.S. troops, despite American demands that any pullout be subject to prevailing security conditions. 'Iraqis would like to know and see a fixed date,' spokesman Ali al-Dabbagh said in an interview in which he also reiterated Iraq's position that American forces be subject to Iraqi legal jurisdiction in some instances. [Washington Post, 11/7/08 ] NOVEMBER 13, 2008. 2 U.S. Troops Killed by Iraqi Soldier. An Iraqi soldier armed with an AK-47 assault rifle rigged with an extra large magazine opened fire on U.S. soldiers in the northern city of Mosul, killing two and wounding six, U.S. military officials said. American soldiers returned fire, killing the Iraqi soldier. The American soldiers were in the courtyard of an Iraqi army outpost in Zanjeli, in western Mosul, waiting for their lieutenant to wrap up a meeting with an Iraqi army captain, U.S. and Iraqi officials said. [Washington Post, 11/13/08 ] NOVEMBER 16, 2008. Iraq Head, Top Cleric Back 2011 Exit by U.S. Iraq's prime minister, Nouri al-Maliki, and its most influential Shiite cleric, Grand Ayatollah Sistani, have decided to support a security agreement that would allow U.S. troops to remain in the country until the end of 2011, sharply increasing its chances of passage in the Iraqi parliament, officials said Saturday. Approval of the so-called status of forces agreement would be a cause for relief among Bush administration officials, who have grown increasingly concerned that U.S. forces would begin the new year with no legal basis to remain in Iraq. A U.N. mandate authorizing their presence is set to expire Dec. 31. [Washington Post, 11/16/08 ] NOVEMBER 17, 2008. Iraq's Cabinet Overwhelmingly Approves the Status of Forces Agreement. The cabinet's decision brings a final date for the departure of American troops a significant step closer after more than five and a half years of war. The proposed pact must still be approved by Iraq's Parliament, in a vote scheduled to take place in a week. But leaders of some of the largest parliamentary blocs expressed confidence that with the backing of most Shiites and Kurds they had enough support to ensure its approval. [New York Times, 11/17/08 ] NOVEMBER 27, 2008. Iraqi Parliament Passes Agreement. The Iraqi Parliament ratified a sweeping security agreement that sets the course for an end to the United States' role in the war and marks the beginning of a new relationship between the countries. It passed on a vote of 149 to 35, according to a parliamentary statement. The pact, which still must be approved by Iraq's three-person presidency council, a move expected in the next few days, sets the end of 2011 as the date by which the last American troops must leave the country. Approved along with the security pact was a law requiring a referendum on the pact to be held in July 2009. Many Sunnis and independents in Parliament cited the referendum to justify their support of the agreement. [New York Times, 11/27/08 ] NOVEMBER 29, 2008. Suicide Bombing At Mosque In Iraq. A suicide bomber detonated explosives outside a Shiite mosque south of Baghdad, police said, killing at least 12 people and injuring 23 a day after Iraqi lawmakers approved a security pact to extend the U.S. military presence in Iraq. The attack in the city of Musayyib, 40 miles south of the capital, occurred as people were gathered outside the mosque before the start of Friday prayers, witnesses and police said. The mosque is run by loyalists of Shiite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr. [Washington Post, 11/29/08 ] NOVEMBER 30, 3008. Top Shiite Cleric in Iraq Raises Concerns About Security Pact. Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani has expressed concern about the country's security agreement with the United States, saying it gives the Americans the upper hand and does not do enough to protect Iraqi sovereignty, an official at his office said. Sistani, whose words carry great weight in Iraq, did not reject the pact outright and indicated that he would leave it to voters to decide its fate in a national referendum to be held by July 30. [Washington Post, 11/30/08 ] DECEMBER 1, 2008. Bomb Attacks Kill at Least 27, Wound Dozens in Iraq. Bombing attacks targeting Iraqi security forces in Baghdad and a U.S. patrol in the northern city of Mosul left at least 27 people dead and dozens more injured, Iraqi officials said, marking one of the deadliest days in recent weeks in Iraq. The attacks highlighted the fragility of Iraq's security situation as the country prepares for provincial elections early next year. The United Nations mission in Iraq warned Sunday that violence could rise in the run-up to the voting. [Washington Post, 12/1/08 ] DECEMBER 11, 2008. Suicide Bomber Kills 48 In Kirkuk. A suicide bomber attacked a packed restaurant on Thursday where Sunni Arabs and Kurds were meeting to ease friction in the tense northern city of Kirkuk. At least 48 people were killed in the bombing, apparently aimed at provoking extremists along widening ethnic fault lines just as American plans to withdraw militarily from Iraq became official. Nearly 100 were wounded in the bombing, which was the deadliest in Iraq in six months. [New York Times, 12/11/08 ] DECEMBER 28, 2008. Iraqi Leader's Protest Gaza Strikes. Iraqi President Jalal Al Talabani met with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri Al Maliki to discuss Gaza. Also, Iraqi Vice-President Tariq Al Hashemi, suspended his travelling schedule because of the events in Gaza, and asked US ambassador to Iraq, Ryan Crocker to tell US President George W Bush to pressure Israel to halt its attacks. [Gulf News, 12/28/08 ] JANUARY 9, 2009. Tens of thousands of Iraqis protest against Israel's offensive in the Gaza Strip. Protesters waved Palestinian flags and burned Israeli and U.S. flags in the Baghdad Shi'ite slum of Sadr City after Friday prayers. Smaller protests were held and anti-Israeli sermons delivered in the Sunni Adhamiya district, the Sunni city of Falluja and the holy Shi'ite city of Najaf. [Reuters, 1/9/09 ] FEBRUARY 3, 2009. Maliki Supporters Post Election Gains. Preliminary results from provincial elections, the first national balloting in four years, are not expected for several days, but election and party officials across Iraq said that politicians allied with Maliki have posted large gains in the capital, Baghdad, and in southern Iraq, the country's Shiite heartland. Such results would strengthen Maliki's standing and that of his Dawa party ahead of parliamentary elections set for this year. [Washington Post, 2/3/09 ] FEBRUARY 5, 2009. Anbar Sheikhs Promise Violence If Elections Don't Favor Them. America's key ally in once-volatile Anbar province explained what he would do if the counting of votes in Saturday's election failed to show his party as the victor. 'We will form the government of Anbar anyway,' vowed Ahmed Abu Risha. 'An honest dictatorship is better than a democracy won through fraud,' Abu Risha said. Here, in the cradle of the Sunni insurgency, tribal leaders nurtured and empowered by the United States appear ready to take control the old-fashioned way - with guns and money - if their political ambitions are frustrated. [Washington Post, 2/5/09 ] FEBRUARY 6, 2009. President Obama Weighing Withdrawal Options. The White House is considering at least two troop withdrawal options as it weighs a new Iraq strategy - one that would preserve President Barack Obama's campaign pledge to get all combat brigades out within 16 months and a second that would stretch it to 23 months, two officials said Friday. Under either timeline, the U.S. would hope to leave behind a number of brigades that would be redesigned and reconfigured as multipurpose units to provide training and advising for Iraqi security forces, one official said. These brigades would be considered noncombat outfits and their presence would have to be agreed in advance by the Iraqi government, which under a deal signed late last year insisted that all U.S. forces - not just combat brigades - be out of Iraq by the end of 2011.

Defense Secretary Robert Gates suggested today that he was open to allowing the media to photograph the flag-draped coffins of fallen soldiers as their bodies and remains are returned to the United States. Gates said he was ordering a review of the military policy that bars photographers from taking pictures of the return of the coffins, most of which are coming from Iraq and Afghanistan and go through Dover Air Force Base in Delaware. The military has said the policy is meant to protect the privacy of the families of the dead soldiers and maintain dignity. But skeptics, who include some families as well as opponents of the war in Iraq, say that the bodies in the returning coffins are not publicly identified, so privacy is not an issue, and that barring photographers is a political maneuver meant to sanitize the war. [New York Times, 2/10/09 ] FEBRUARY 11, 2009. At least 26 killed in bombings and shootings. Twin car bombings ripped through a Baghdad bus station killing 16 people, as violence across Iraq claimed at least 26 lives and shattered a relative lull marked by largely peaceful elections.

The release of hundreds of prisoners from Camp Bucca, a U.S.-run prison in southern Iraq, has facilitated the revival of Shiite militias and Sunni insurgents in Basra, Baghdad and the borderless expanse here along the Euphrates, according to police chiefs, intelligence officials in the Interior Ministry and residents. Although none of them predicted a return to the anarchy and sectarian carnage of 2006-2007, when scores of bodies might show up in the street on any day, officials suggested that the groups were preparing for the onset of a U.S. military withdrawal.

The most senior U.S. general in Iraq said that if security continues to improve and political progress advances, he may recommend further troop reductions by the end of this summer. But big challenges remain, Gen. Raymond Odierno said, including the threat that a new hiring freeze by Iraqi security forces, forced on Baghdad by falling oil prices, could imperil gains. The U.S. military said this month that 12,000 American troops, in addition to 4,000 British forces, will leave Iraq within six months. Gen. Odierno said he will make a decision by early September on whether the U.S. troop presence could decrease further. [Wall Street Journal, 3/23/09 ] MARCH 23, 2009.

'You have given Iraq the opportunity to stand on its own as a democratic country.' Obama, in Iraq after an eight-day trip through Europe and Turkey, said he was heartened that Iraqis were increasingly fighting their battles in the political arena rather than on the street. But he cautioned that Iraq's upcoming national election is likely to bring many of the country's unresolved political issues 'to a head.'

Speaking to an audience at the U.S. Institute of Peace in Washington, Maliki said the accord, known as the Status of Forces Agreement, would 'end' the American military presence in his country in 2011, but 'nevertheless, if Iraqi forces required further training and further support, we shall examine this at that time based on the needs of Iraq,' he said through translation in response to a question from The Washington Independent.

U.S. troops could be forced by Iraqi voters to withdraw a year ahead of schedule under a referendum the Iraqi government backed Monday, creating a potential complication for American commanders concerned about rising violence in the country's north. Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's move appeared to disregard the wishes of the U.S. government, which has quietly lobbied against the plebiscite. American officials fear it could lead to the annulment of an agreement allowing U.S. troops to stay until the end of 2011, and instead force them out by the start of that year.

Though his influence had waned in the two years since his cancer was diagnosed, he continued to play an active role in politics almost to the end. But his death probably will further diminish the standing of his political movement, opening the door to potential Shiite challengers, analysts said. [Los Angeles Times, 8/27/90 ] AUGUST 30, 2009.

A suicide bomber detonated himself among mourners at a funeral in western Iraq on Monday, killing six people and wounding 16 in a region that has grown increasingly violent during the past few months.The bomber, a man in his 20s who wore a belt packed with explosives, walked into a crowd that had gathered inside a tent for a woman's funeral in the Anbar Province town of Haditha before blowing himself up, an Iraqi security official said on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak to the media. [New York Times, 10/5/09 ] OCTOBER 6, 2009. Ayatollah Sistani Supports Open Voting. Iraq's most revered Shiite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani said that he supports the open-list system in the upcoming January's general elections, otherwise the turnout will suffer negative impact if closed-list system adopted by the parliament, a Sistani spokesman said on Tuesday. 'The religious Marjiyah (highest Shiite leadership) calls on the members of the Iraqi Representatives Council to live up to their responsibility and to respond positively to the desire of the majority of the Iraqi people in adopting the system of the open-list in the upcoming parliamentary elections,' a spokesman of Sistani's office in the city of Najaf told Xinhua on condition of anonymity. Citing a statement by Sistani, the spokesman warned that the adoption of the closed-list system will strongly limit the turnout in the coming elections which 'will have negative impacts on the democratic process in Iraq.' [Xinhua, 10/6/09 ] OCTOBER 12, 2009. Opposition Grows to Iraqi Election Plan. Iraqi legislators face a Thursday deadline to approve an election law for January's parliamentary polls, while opposition grows against plans for a so-called closed-list ballot. The election, slated for Jan. 16, is being closely watched by the U.S. as a barometer of the country's stability amid a drawdown of American forces. Overall security has improved, but high-profile attacks continue. Lawmakers have been wrangling for weeks on passing legislation to establish rules about how the race will be run and what the ballot will look like. Issues over how voting will be held in the contested northern oil city of Kirkuk - claimed by Kurds, Arabs and Turkomen - have held up the legislation. [Wall Street Journal, 10/12/09 ] OCTOBER 12, 2009. 3 Bombings Target Police in Iraq. Three car bombings targeted a police station and a government headquarters in the provincial capital of Ramadi in western Iraq on Sunday, killing at least 25 people and underlining the precarious situation in Anbar province. Violence in the province had fallen sharply in the past year after local tribal leaders, backed by U.S. forces, defeated a homegrown al-Qaeda group and other militants. But explosions and suicide attacks in recent weeks were reminiscent of 2003 and 2004, when the insurgency was gathering strength. [Washington Post, 10/12/09 ] OCTOBER 16, 2009. Attacker Kills 16 in Mosque. A man stood up during Friday Prayer in a violence-plagued town in northern Iraq and shot the prayer leader at point-blank range with an assault rifle before spraying the kneeling worshipers around him and detonating a suicide belt, killing 15 people, witnesses said. The attack also wounded 100 others inside the Taqwa mosque in Tal Afar, a town in the northern province of Nineveh that is among several areas contested by various ethnic and religious groups in Iraq's north. [New York Times, 10/16/09 ] OCTOBER 16, 2009. Sadrists Push Electoral Reform. In an unexpected twist for Iraq's nascent democracy, an anti-American party is speeding ahead with electoral reform while the Iraqi parliament is gridlocked over how to run national elections slated for January. On Friday, supporters of radical Shiite cleric Muqtada al-Sadr voted directly for candidates in a primary poll ahead of national elections, calling it a milestone in the democratic process. The vote is believed by Iraqi officials to be the first time that choosing candidates for any party outside Iraqi Kurdistan has been placed in the hands of ordinary Iraqis. [Christian Science Monitor, 10/16/09 ] OCTOBER 25, 2009. Deadly Bombings Worst Iraq Attack In Two Years. Twin car bombs exploded near three Iraqi government buildings Sunday in central Baghdad, killing at least 132 people. It was the deadliest attack in the country in more than two years. More than 500 people were wounded. The blasts had ripple effects throughout the country, triggering questions about the state of Iraqi security and about national elections planned for January. No one immediately claimed responsibility. [CNN, 10/25/09 ] OCTOBER 27, 2009. Extremist group claims responsibility for Baghdad bombs. The Islamic State of Iraq, a Sunni extremist group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq, has claimed responsibility for twin bombings Sunday that targeted key government buildings and killed nearly 160 Iraqis, according to a claim posted online. The group called the targeted sites 'dens of infidelity,' according to a statement posted on a Web site used by extremists to make such claims. Its authenticity could not be independently verified. The group also claimed responsibility for similar bombings that killed more than 100 people in August. The devastating bombings at the Justice Ministry, the Baghdad Provincial Council and the Ministry of Municipalities and Public Works appeared designed to portray the Shiite-led government as feeble and rudderless ahead of parliamentary elections scheduled for January. They are expected to cripple key government agencies for months. [Washington Post, 10/27/09 ] DECEMBER 6, 2008. After Delays, Deal Set on Iraq Election Law. Lawmakers pulled Iraq back from the brink of a constitutional crisis on Sunday night, brokering a last-minute compromise that will allow for the first national elections since 2005. A deal on the election law has fallen apart before, underscoring the deep sectarian divide that remains in Iraq, despite a drop in violence. Fighting over the law also threatens to complicate the American withdrawal. After months of wrangling, the Iraqi Parliament gathered just before midnight to approve a deal that had been secured only hours before in closed-door talks. [New York Times, 12/6/09 ] DECEMBER 8, 2009. Blast Near Baghdad School Wounds Many Children. An explosion near a school in the Sadr City district of Baghdad on Monday wounded scores of children, while attacks on Iraq's security forces continued. Government officials gave contradictory accounts of the school casualty figures, with the death toll from the blast varying from one to 15 children and the number of wounded from 41 to 56. There were competing theories about what caused the blast. In a statement read on state television by Maj. Gen. Qassam Atta, a spokesman for the Baghdad Operation Command, the government said it was the result of an accidental detonation of a cache of explosives hidden near the school. Earlier reports from local security officials, however, suggested that it could have been the result of an errant missile or a planted explosive device. The disagreement over the basic facts reflected the degree to which Iraqi security forces often lack coordination in responding to attacks. [New York Times, 12/8/09 ] JANUARY 1, 2010. Judge Dismisses Charges Against Blackwater Guards in Iraq Deaths A federal judge dismissed charges against five Blackwater Worldwide security guards accused of killing 14 Iraqi civilians in a controversial shooting in a busy Baghdad square two years ago in a ruling that sharply criticized the tactics of Justice Department prosecutors handling the case. The judge, Ricardo M. Urbina of the District's federal court, found that prosecutors and agents had improperly used statements that the guards provided to the State Department in the hours and days after the shooting. The statements had been given with the understanding that they would not be used against the guards in court, the judge found, and federal prosecutors improperly used them to help guide their investigation. Urbina said other Justice Department lawyers had warned the prosecutors to tread carefully around the incriminating statements. [Washington Post, 1/1/10 ] JANUARY 2, 2010. Day of mixed emotions in Baghdad: Elation for U.S., but anger for Iraqis U.S. commanders in Iraq began the new year Friday by trumpeting a milestone - their first month without a combat death since the start of the war - and by sending a clear signal that their focus in 2010 will be on getting out of the country that American forces invaded nearly seven years ago. But for Iraqis, Friday was marked by bitter recriminations over a U.S. judge's decision to dismiss charges against five Blackwater security guards who had been accused of killing 14 Iraqi civilians and wounding 20 others in 2007 - a reminder that resentments toward the American occupation will linger long after U.S. troops have gone home. [Washington Post, 1/2/10 ] JANUARY 4, 2010. Crackdown On Alcohol Seen as Part of Conservative Moment in Iraq. The March 2003 U.S. invasion and subsequent violence have made Iraq's moral compass swing wildly for the past six years. It has been a time of lax government authority; power struggles among armed groups including the Mahdi Army and al-Qaeda in Iraq, which imposed strict norms; and mass migration, which has changed the makeup and character of entire towns and cities. In recent months, the pendulum has veered toward conservative mores. Government officials, including many competing in the upcoming parliamentary election, have sought to impose stricter limits on alcohol consumption and coeducational schools. [Washington Post, 1/4/10 ] JANUARY 5, 2010. Suspect in Deaths of 5 G.I.'s Is Freed, Iraqi Official Says. An Iraqi accused of being behind the killings in 2007 of five American soldiers has been released by the Iraqi government, according to an Iraqi official. 'According to my personal information, he was released two days ago,' the official, Alaa al-Taei, a spokesman for the Interior Ministry, said Tuesday. The suspect, Qais al-Khazali, is accused of being a leader of a militia, Asa'ib al-Haq, or the League of the Righteous. He was transferred from American military custody to Iraqi hands last week. That transfer came hours before the militia released a British computer expert, Peter Moore, whom it had held for two and a half years. [New York Times, 1/5/10 ] JANUARY 7, 2010. Move Made to Bar Iraqi Sunni From Ballot. An Iraqi parliamentary committee moved Thursday to bar a Sunni Muslim lawmaker from national elections in March, outraging his supporters and threatening to worsen sectarian tension here. The lawmaker, Saleh al-Mutlaq, a prominent Sunni politician, and his group, the National Dialogue Front, were among those disqualified on the grounds of promoting the banned Baath Party of former President Saddam Hussein. While the decision is not final - Iraq's election commission must ratify it - Mr. Mutlaq also suggested that he had no real recourse and warned of the implications. 'They fear my popularity,' he said in an interview. 'They think that banning me from the elections will isolate the Sunnis, stop them from taking part and marginalize them.' [New York Times, 1/7/10 ] JANUARY 7, 2010. Iraq bars 15 political parties with Baathist ties from upcoming elections. At least 15 parties will be banned from upcoming parliamentary elections because they have been linked to Saddam Hussein's Baath Party or have promoted Baathist ideals, Iraqi officials said Thursday. The decision by the Justice and Accountability Commission, in charge of cleansing high-level Baathists from the ranks of the government and security forces, seemed to be an attempt to purge candidates with links to the old political order, many of whom are popular among secular nationalist voters. The move is a blow to hopes of bringing opposition figures - who turned to violent resistance over the past seven years - into the political fold, part of the U.S. strategy to bolster the government. [Washington Post, 1/8/10 ] JANUARY 13, 2010. Iraq Says Raid Uncovered a Plot to Bomb Ministries. A wide-ranging plot to bomb government ministries and other public places, to be followed by a wave of political assassinations, was uncovered by Iraqi officials, who responded Tuesday by bringing much of Baghdad to a virtual standstill while security forces conducted raids that netted large quantities of explosives, officials said. At least 4 suicide car bombers - and as many as 10 - were apparently on their way to government buildings on Tuesday morning when they were stopped by the police and arrested, the authorities said. [New York Times, 1/13/10 ] JANUARY 13, 2010. Seven killed by suicide truck bomber in western Iraq. Seven people have died as a suicide bomber blew up a truck near a police station in western Iraq, security officials say. At least two police officers were among the dead, while another six people were injured in the blast in Saqlawiya in Anbar province, officials said. The bombing comes a week after attacks targeting police killed eight people in the town of Hit in the same province. [BBC, 1/13/10 ] JANUARY 13, 2010. Pentagon Weighs Cleanups as It Plans Iraq Exit. As the U.S. military prepares to leave Iraq, the Pentagon is wrestling with questions about environmental cleanup on the bases it plans to transfer to the Iraqi Army by December 2011. At issue on and around the bases are unexploded ordinance, depleted uranium from munitions, spilled oil and contaminated ash in burn pits. There is no set answer about what - if anything - the military must do to mitigate environmental damage. Though there are clear environmental policies for permanent U.S. bases overseas, they do not apply to contingency operations like those in Iraq. 'There's nothing in international law, U.S. law, or executive orders that guide [U.S.] policy' in such operations, said David Mosher, a senior policy fellow at RAND and co-author of a 2008 report for the Army on environmental considerations during contingency operations. 'It's a huge loophole,' he said. 'There's nothing in DOD policy that says anything should be done.' [New York Times, 1/13/10 ] JANUARY 14, 2010. 11 Iraqis Sentenced to Death for Baghdad Bombings. A court sentenced 11 Iraqis on Thursday to death by hanging for planning and carrying out massive truck bombings in Baghdad last August that killed 95 people and wounded more than 1,000. The bombs targeted Iraq's foreign and finance ministries, sites that are among the most heavily guarded in Iraq, and damaged public confidence in Iraqi forces ahead of an election in March and as U.S. troops prepare to withdraw. [Reuters, 1/14/10 ] JANUARY 14, 2010. Multiple Bombs Rock Najaf. Three bombs exploded in the Iraqi seminary city of Najaf, killing at least 15 people and wounding dozens of others, security sources say. Initial reports suggested that the bombs were detonated near a market in the city centre, filled with shoppers in the early evening. The mainly Shia city, some 90 miles (150km) south of Baghdad, attracts thousands of pilgrims each year. [BBC, 1/14/10 ] JANUARY 23, 2010. Biden Visits Iraq Amid Election Row. Vice President Joe Biden told Iraqi officials on Saturday the United States backed a ban on Saddam Hussein's Baath party and said he had faith Iraq would resolve a row over the banning of election candidates suspected of links to it. The move by an independent panel has outraged Sunnis who dominated Iraq for more than two decades under Saddam and who see it as an attempt to marginalize their community, casting doubt on the inclusiveness and legitimacy of a March 7 vote. U.S. officials say the arbitrary way the list appears to have been drawn up and the questionable legitimacy of the panel could undermine the election. But Biden, on his third visit to Iraq since U.S. troops pulled out of city centers in June, said Washington had no problem with holding Baath party loyalists accountable. [Reuters, 1/23/10 ] JANUARY 25, 2010. Baghdad Bombs Kill 36, Chemical Ali Hanged. Suicide bombers attacked three hotels used by foreigners in the heart of Baghdad on Monday, killing at least 36 people and raising questions about government pledges to keep Iraqis safe before a March election. The car bombs wounded at least 71 people as Iraq executed the man known as 'Chemical Ali' under Saddam Hussein for his use of poison gas against minority Kurds. The hanging of Ali Hassan al-Majeed for crimes against humanity was a high-profile step in the Shi'ite-led government's prosecution of Saddam's Sunni-dominated regime and was likely to fan controversy six weeks before the March 7 parliamentary poll. [Reuters, 1/25/10 ] JANUARY 29, 2010. Blair Fights For His Legacy As He Defends Iraq War. In a highly anticipated testimony before an official inquiry into Britain's role in the Iraq conflict, former British PRime Minister Tony Blair defended himself against critics who contend it was folly to join the Americans in invading Iraq based on intelligence that was faulty and weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist. Blair showed his impressive rhetorical skills and high-minded principles, but left unanswered whether the war that defines his mixed legacy was justified. Many in the audience, including the relatives of soldiers and civilians killed in the war, were not impressed. Blair's claim to have no regrets drew an angry outburst. As he left, one man stood up and shouted 'You are a liar!' A second added: 'And a murderer.' The six-hour session Friday capped a wide-ranging inquiry that since November has heard extensive evidence from government lawyers and ministers who raised doubts about the legality and wisdom of the 2003 Iraq invasion, which was extremely unpopular in Britain. The Iraq Inquiry panel plans to issue a report next year, but does not have a mandate to apportion blame or the power to bring any criminal charges. [Washington Post, 1/29/10 ] FEBRUARY 1, 2010. Female Suicide Bomber Kills Dozens. At least 41 people were killed by a female suicide bomber in north-east Baghdad, an interior ministry spokesman has said. The woman detonated an explosives vest among a group of pilgrims making the journey to Karbala, 80km from Baghdad. At least 106 other pilgrims were hurt in the attack. Troops and police are on alert during the pilgrimage. [BBC, 2/1/10 ] FEBRUARY 4, 2010. Ban on Hundreds of Iraqi Candidates Overturned. Iraq's political crisis deepened after an appeals court overturned a ban on hundreds of candidates in next month's election for having ties to Saddam Hussein's Baath Party, and Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki then disputed that ruling. The ban had prompted threats of election boycotts and warnings that the credibility of the election itself was at stake if political groups, particularly Sunnis, felt disenfranchised. And it stoked fears of renewed violence as American troops were beginning to withdraw. The court also said it would reconsider the ban after the March 7 election, raising the possibility of further political turmoil by ousting elected members of Parliament should their ties with the Baath Party be established. The initial effort to knock more than 500 candidates off the ballot - both Sunnis and Shiites, but mostly those viewed as rivals to Mr. Maliki's bloc - created a political furor and deeply alarmed American and United Nations officials. [New York Times, 2/4/10 ] FEBRUARY 5, 2010. Blast Strikes Shiite Pilgrims in Iraq. At least two explosions tore through crowds marching to the burial place of Shiite Islam's most revered martyr Friday in the culmination of ritual mourning that has drawn millions to the holy city of Karbala in one of the world's largest pilgrimages. At least 27 people were killed and dozens more wounded. [New York Times, 2/5/10 ] FEBRUARY 26, 2010. Sectarian tensions rise before Iraq elections. A popular Sunni political party backtracked on Thursday from plans to boycott Iraq's parliamentary elections even as rivals threatened to have the party's leader charged with terrorism. The developments illustrate the increasing tensions as Iraq prepares for the March 7 elections and U.S. combat troops get ready to withdraw by August. The sectarian divide is widening, and the National Dialogue Front said it will not participate in the elections amid fears that Shiite parties have rigged the vote against secular and Sunni candidates. But Saleh al-Mutlak, the party's leader, said the National Dialogue Front, a party within the secular Iraqiya slate, had received popular support urging its participation. 'If Iraqiya doesn't succeed, the whole of Iraq will be in real chaos,' he said. 'We don't want to be seen as the reason behind that chaos.' [Washington Post, 3/26/10 ] FEBRUARY 28, 2010. Iraqi PM calls pre-vote candidate ban legitimate. Iraq's prime minister Sunday defended a ban of candidates with alleged ties to Saddam Hussein's former regime, calling it a legitimate decision that would not affect Sunni turnout at the polls. The decision to bar hundreds of candidates from the election, including two prominent Sunni lawmakers, for alleged ties to Saddam's ruling party has dominated Iraq's political debate for weeks and reflects the deep sectarian differences that still divide the country. [AP, 2/28/10 ] MARCH 1, 2010. Before Iraq election, Arab and Kurd tensions soar in the north. In a sign of heightened Arab-Kurd tension along a disputed boundary just days from Iraq elections, the president of Iraqi Kurdistan says the governor of the adjoining Arab-majority province will be arrested if he enters Kurdish-controlled areas. In an interview with The Christian Science Monitor at his mountaintop headquarters in northern Iraq, Kurdish President Massoud Barzani described Ninevah governor Atheel al-Nujaifi as a 'criminal' and said a warrant would be issued for his arrest in connection with an incident this month involving US forces. He also said Nujaifi had failed to secure the provincial capital of Mosul. Mr. Barzani offered to bring up to 2,000 Christian university students from the troubled city to Kurdistan to continue their studies. At least eight Christians have been killed in the last two weeks in Mosul in the latest wave of attacks on minorities. [Christian Science Monitor, 3/1/10 ] MARCH 4, 2010. Three Bombings in Diyala province Kill At Least 33 People. Three bombings in Iraq's Diyala province targeting government and medical buildings killed at least 33 people Wednesday morning, raising fears about deteriorating security days before Sunday's parliamentary elections. Iraqi police officials said at least 55 people were wounded in the blasts. The initial explosion, a car bomb, targeted an Iraqi police station about 9:45 a.m. in a western district of Baqubah, the provincial capital, according to Maj. Ghalib Aativa, a police spokesman. The detonation ripped through a nearby building and reduced it to rubble. Minutes later, a suicide bomber in a car detonated explosives near the main provincial building, which has been the target of numerous attacks in recent years. The blast destroyed the office of former prime minister Ibrahim al-Jafari's political party. Jafari, a Shiite, is a candidate in the elections. [Washington Post, 3/4/10 ] MARCH 4, 2010. Bombings Mar First Day of Early Voting In Iraq. A roadside bomb and two suicide bombers targeting polling stations in Baghdad killed at least 12 people Thursday, marring the first day of voting to elect the government that will rule as U.S. troops withdraw from Iraq. Security forces, inmates and hospital patients were allowed to vote Thursday, ahead of Sunday's general election. 'The terrorists are targeting our polling stations today to scare the civilians,' said Sgt. Waleed Tariq, who was among those voting at one of the stations hit in western Baghdad. 'They let them think: If they're able to kill security forces on their election day, what will happen to us on Sunday?' [Washington Post, 3/4/10 ] MARCH 7, 2010. Iraq parliamentary election hit by insurgent attacks. Iraq's second parliamentary election since the 2003 invasion has been hit by multiple attacks, with at least 35 people being killed. Two buildings were destroyed in Baghdad and dozens of mortars were fired across the capital and elsewhere. Despite the violence, there were long queues of voters at polling stations in a number of cities. Polls closed at 1700 (1400 GMT) but people already in line were allowed to cast their votes. An immense security operation was mounted, involving more than 500,000 Iraqi security personnel. The border with Iran was closed, thousands of troops were deployed, and vehicles were banned from roads. [BBC, 3/7/10 ] MARCH 8, 2010. U.S. Officials Say U.S. on Schedule to Draw Down Troops in Iraq by August. Iraqi forces are on track to assume control of the country's security, and the United States is on course to draw down its troops to 50,000 by President Obama's August deadline, U.S. officials said today. Iraqis voted this weekend in a historic parliamentary election that Obama hailed Sunday as an 'important milestone' in the country's history. It was the second election in the country since the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. The top U.S. commander in Iraq, Gen. Ray Odierno, today said the United States is sticking with its plan to draw down troops to 50,000 by the summer. The Iraqi security forces will be ready by the end of next year to take complete responsibility for security in Iraq, he said. 'Yesterday, I think we saw the Iraqi security forces perform very well for the elections, and I believe that they continue to improve every single day and they continue to prove they can protect the Iraqi people,' Odierno said on 'Good Morning America.' [ABC, 3/8/10 ] MARCH 12, 2010. Iraq Election May Leave Kirkuk Status Uncertain. Early election results appear to reflect a hardening of divisions between Kurds, Arabs and Turkmens in northern Iraq, potentially complicating efforts by the United States and the United Nations to forge a compromise over the oil-rich city of Kirkuk - a prize claimed by both Iraq's semiautonomous Kurdistan region and the central government. According to unofficial results released earlier this week, the Kurdistan Alliance, a coalition of the two ruling Kurdish parties, received more than 50 percent of the votes cast in Tamim, the province that includes Kirkuk. Iraq's electoral commission was scheduled to release partial results over the weekend that were not expected to differ significantly from that outcome. [New York Times, 3/12/10 ] MARCH 16, 2010. Eight dead, 11 wounded in Iraq bomb attacks. Eight people died in two bombings five minutes apart on the main street of an Iraqi town south of Baghdad on Tuesday, nine days after an election Iraqis hoped would bring more stability and less sectarian conflict. Police said attackers attached so-called sticky bombs to two cars carrying passengers in the town of Mussayab, about 60 km (40 miles) south of the capital. Eleven others were wounded in the attacks, police said. On Monday a car bomb killed seven people and wounded 20 others in the city of Falluja in Iraq's western Anbar province, an area that has been relatively quiet since Sunni Muslim tribal leaders turned on Islamist insurgent groups like al Qaeda. [Reuters, 3/16/10 ] MARCH 16, 2010. Followers of Sadr Emerge Stronger After Iraq Elections. The followers of Moktada al-Sadr, a radical cleric who led the Shiite insurgency against the American occupation, have emerged as Iraq's equivalent of Lazarus in elections last week, defying ritual predictions of their demise and now threatening to realign the nation's balance of power. Although rivals disparaged the Sadrists' election campaign, documents and interviews show an unprecedented discipline that has thrust the group to the brink of perhaps its greatest political influence in Iraq. [New York Times, 3/16/10 ] MARCH 17, 2010. Iraq needs US help to beat huge refugee crisis. Iraq faces a dire humanitarian crisis as huge numbers of displaced Iraqis struggle to survive in squalid camps and Washington has a 'special responsibility' to help the war-torn country, a report said Wednesday. 'Of the 1.5 million internally displaced people (IDPs) forced from their homes in 2006 and 2007, 33 percent or 500,000 live as squatters in slum areas,' said the report compiled by Refugees International and released on the eve of the seventh anniversary of the US-led invasion of Iraq. To compile the report, Refugees International staff visited 20 squatter camps around Iraq, all lacking basic services including water and sanitation, and often built in precarious places - under bridges, alongside railroad tracks and atop garbage dumps. The Iraqi government is doing little, if anything, to help the displaced, the report said, urging the United States, which 'bears special responsibility' for the looming humanitarian crisis, to step in and take up the slack.

Iraqi Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's coalition has edged ahead in Iraq's parliamentary elections, according to partial results from election officials. The Independent High Electoral Commission announced on Thursday evening that with 89 percent of the votes counted from the March 7 election, al-Maliki's State of Law coalition maintained a narrow lead in seven of Iraq's 18 provinces, including Baghdad province. The province, which includes the capital city, is the most populous. The prime minister's coalition is now ahead of former interim Prime Minister Ayad Allawi's bloc by about 40,000 votes.

Senior Bush administration officials involved in the Iraq war have been asked by a British panel investigating that country's role in the conflict to chat about administration activities and policies from before the March 2003 invasion until 2009. The government-commissioned panel, which has no subpoena power or legal status over there, much less here, has nonetheless gotten most every significant British government official and senior military officer involved in the war to give evidence, in public even. The panel, expected to issue its report at the end of the year, recently grilled former prime minister Tony Blair for six hours on live television and has questioned the current prime minister, Gordon Brown. [Washington Post, 3/19/10 ] MARCH 19, 2010. Iraq's Kurds Lose Political Dominance In Kirkuk. Before the March 7 parliamentary elections in Iraq, there was no question of who dominated politics in mixed-population Kirkuk - it was the two main political factions in the neighboring Kurdish autonomous region. But with the vote count from Kirkuk city and its surrounding Tamin Province about 80 percent complete, it is clear that the political landscape is dramatically changing. The partial vote count shows the secular Al-Iraqiyah coalition and the Kurdistan Alliance in a virtual tie, with the balance between them shifting by only wafer-thin differences as the vote tally rises. If the current balance holds, it means that the divided province's Turkoman and Arab populations will have a much louder political voice than before. That in turn could complicate Kurdish hopes of one day incorporating oil-rich Kirkuk into their autonomous region. Turkoman politicians in Kirkuk make no secret of the fact that they competed in the parliamentary contest precisely with that goal in mind. [RFE/RL, 3/19/10 ] MARCH 26, 2010. Secular Challenger Allawi Claims Iraq Election Win. A jubilant Ayad Allawi claimed victory for his secular, anti-Iranian coalition as final parliamentary returns Friday showed him edging out the bloc of Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, who angrily vowed to fight the results. The results, if they stand, will give Allawi the first opportunity to form a parliamentary majority and Iraq's next government. But they do not automatically mean that he will become prime minister, and the narrow margin sets the stage for months of political wrangling. [Associated Press, 3/26/10 ] MARCH 28, 2010. Allawi Reaches Out After Iraq Election Win. Former prime minister Ayad Allawi began reaching out to other political blocs Saturday for allies he needs to form Iraq's next government, while accusing his main rival, Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, of maneuvering to undercut his victory in the March 7 parliamentary elections. Allawi, whose Iraqiya list bested Maliki's State of Law coalition by two seats, 91 to 89, in results announced Friday, faces the greater challenge in putting together a majority. A secular Shiite who won by attracting Sunni Arab and secular voters, Allawi will have to woo other Shiite politicians - some of whom view Maliki as a more palatable, albeit imperfect, option - as well as Kurds.

The Web site WikiLeaks.org released a graphic video on Monday showing an American helicopter shooting and killing a Reuters photographer and driver in a July 2007 attack in Baghdad. A senior American military official confirmed that the video was authentic. Reuters had long pressed for the release of the video, which consists of 38 minutes of black-and-white aerial video and conversations between pilots in two Apache helicopters as they open fire on people on a street in Baghdad. The attack killed 12, among them the Reuters photographer, Namir Noor-Eldeen, 22, and the driver, Saeed Chmagh, 40. Reuters employees were allowed to view the video on an off-the-record basis two weeks after the killings, but they were not allowed to obtain a copy of it. The news organization said its Freedom of Information Act requests were not approved. At a news conference at the National Press Club, WikiLeaks said it had acquired the video from whistle-blowers in the military and viewed it after breaking the encryption code. WikiLeaks released the full 38-minute video as well as a 17-minute edited version. [NY Times, 4/5/10 ] APRIL 19, 2010. Secret prison revealed in Baghdad. Hundreds of Sunni men disappeared for months into a secret Baghdad prison under the jurisdiction of Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's military office, where many were routinely tortured until the country's Human Rights Ministry gained access to the facility, Iraqi officials say. The men were detained by the Iraqi army in October in sweeps targeting Sunni groups in Nineveh province, a stronghold of the group Al Qaeda in Iraq and other militants in the north. The provincial governor alleged at the time that ordinary citizens had been detained as well, often without a warrant. [LA Times, 4/19/10 ] APRIL 19, 2010. Top Two Al-Qaeda in Iraq Chiefs Killed. The two leading Al-Qaeda figures in Iraq were killed in a major operation involving US forces north of the capital Baghdad, Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki said on state television Monday. Abu Omar al-Baghdadi and Abu Ayub al-Masri were killed on Saturday in Salaheddin province by Iraqi intelligence agents who received US assistance, Maliki said, showing pictures of both men before and after their deaths. The Baghdad government has previously announced the capture and killing of Baghdadi on several occasions and his real influence in Al-Qaeda has been called into question by the US military. Maliki told reporters that Baghdadi and Masri's identities had been confirmed after medical tests. [AFP, 4/19/10 ] APRIL 19, 2010. Iraq judicial panel orders recount. An Iraqi judicial panel on Monday ordered a manual recount of about 2.5 million ballots cast in Baghdad in last month's national elections, an action requested by Prime Minister Nouri Maliki's alliance, which had filed allegations of vote fraud. The legal decision raised Maliki's hopes that his Shiite-dominated coalition would be awarded more parliamentary seats than his rival Iyad Allawi's secular bloc, which had stunned the nation by winning a slim plurality in the March 7 vote. But it also raised fears that if the results are overturned, Iraq's minority Sunni Arab population, which had turned out in large numbers to cast ballots for former Prime Minister Allawi's alliance, would view the elections as stolen and launch a new armed revolt. [LA Times, 4/19/10 ] US military deaths in Iraq war at 4,392. As of Tuesday, April 20, 2010, at least 4,392 members of the U.S. military had died in the Iraq war since it began in March 2003, according to an Associated Press count. The figure includes nine military civilians killed in action. At least 3,482 military personnel died as a result of hostile action, according to the military's numbers. [AP, 4/20/10 ] APRIL 21, 2010. U.S. military: Senior al Qaeda in Iraq leader killed. Iraqi security forces killed a suspected senior leader of al Qaeda in Iraq during an operation in the northern city of Mosul, the U.S. military said. On Monday Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki said two of the most wanted terrorist figures in Iraq had been killed in a joint Iraqi-U.S. operation. Abu Ayyub al-Masri, leader of al Qaeda in Iraq, and Abu Omar al-Baghdadi, leader of the Islamic State of Iraq - an umbrella group that includes al Qaeda in Iraq - were killed in a security operation in al-Tharthar, north of Baghdad, al-Maliki said. [CNN, 4/21/10 ] APRIL 23, 2010. Wave of deadly bombings hits Iraq. A series of bombings mainly targeting Shiite worshippers killed at least 60 people on Friday, officials said, just days after U.S. and Iraqi forces killed the top two al-Qaida leaders in Iraq in what was described as devastating blow to the insurgency. The apparently coordinated attacks, which occurred in a two-hour span, demonstrated insurgents remain a potent force despite U.S. and Iraqi claims that the terror network is on the run. At least 10 car bombs and roadside attacks struck the capital, according to Iraqi police. No suicide bombings - an al-Qaida trademark - were reported but Iraqi authorities were quick to blame the Sunni-led terror network, which frequently targets Shiites. [AP, 4/23/10 ] MAY 5, 2010. Iraq's two top Shiite blocs merge. Almost two months after national elections, Iraq's two biggest Shiite blocs announced have announced their merger after weeks of negotiations. Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki's State of Law Coalition and the Iraqi National Alliance, a coalition of powerful Shiite parties backed by Iran, now have a bloc with 159 seats - just four seats away from the majority they'll need to form a cabinet. The Iraqi National Alliance includes two of the country's most powerful Shiite parties: the Islamic Supreme Council of Iraq and the anti-American Sadrist movement. [CNN, 5/5/10 ] MAY 9, 2010. Bombs planted in home of policeman kill 3 in Iraq. Bombs planted inside the home of a policeman in northern Iraq exploded Saturday, killing him, his mother and one other resident, a security official said. The bombing was one of several attacks around Iraq's north that killed at least 10 people over the weekend, a sign that authorities are struggling to maintain security as the country's politicians clamor over the shape of a new government two months after an inconclusive election. The early morning attack took place on a home in the town of Amirli, just south of the oil-rich city of Kirkuk, and injured five other people. [AP, 5/9/10 ] MAY 10, 2010. 71 dead in widespread Iraq attacks blamed on al Qaeda. Bombers and gunmen seen as linked to a battered but still lethal al Qaeda killed at least 71 people on Monday in a day-long wave of attacks on markets, a textile factory, checkpoints and other sites across Iraq. The attacks in far-flung locations including Baghdad and towns in the south, north and west of the capital appeared aimed at showing Iraqis that Sunni Islamist insurgents were still a potent force even after battlefield defeats in recent weeks. 'Despite strong strikes that broke al Qaeda, there are some cells still working, attempting to prove their existence and their influence,' said Baghdad's security spokesman, Major General Qassim al-Moussawi, calling the attacks 'hysterical.' [Reuters, 5/10/10 ] JUNE 13, 2010. At least 24 killed as gunmen storm Iraq's Central Bank. Armed men wearing police-commando uniforms briefly overran Iraq's Central Bank on Sunday, killing at least 24 people in a brazen daylight assault and sowing panic and confusion in the heart of Baghdad's busiest commercial district. The corpses of seven more men wearing uniforms and suspected of being among the assailants were found inside the bank after police finally entered, four hours after the assault began. At least 46 people were injured. [LA Times, 6/13/10 ] JUNE 18, 2010. Top cleric warns Iraq leaders as deal hopes dim. Iraq's two main contenders to head a new government remained at odds Friday, denting US hopes that a top envoy had advanced the prospects of a deal and drawing a warning from the top Shiite cleric. The persistent political vacuum three and a half months after a general election which gave no bloc the necessary majority to form a new administration has caused mounting concern in Washington as it prepares to withdraw 38,000 of its remaining 88,000 troops by the end of August. The bickering also drew an ultimatum from the spiritual leader of Iraq's Shiite Muslim majority community, Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani, to intervene if the politicians did not forge a deal quickly. [AFP, 6/18/10 ] JUNE 18, 2010. Turkey: May air raid killed 100 Kurdish rebels. Turkey's military said it killed as many as 120 Kurdish rebels in an air raid on rebel hideouts in northern Iraq last month and a daylong incursion by elite commandos into Iraq this week. Kurdish rebels have dramatically stepped up attacks in Turkey in recent months in an escalation that poses a dire threat to a remarkable attempt at ending one of the world's longest guerrilla wars. The Turkish military responded to the rebels by sending its warplanes across the Iraqi border to bomb Kurdish rebel positions after acquiring intelligence, apparently from the United States and recently purchased drones from Israel. The rebels have long used northern Iraq as a springboard for hit-and-run attacks on Turkish targets in a campaign for autonomy in Turkey's Kurdish-dominated southeast. Several past Turkish air raids and incursions have failed to stop rebel infiltration through the mountainous border. [AP, 6/18/10 ] JUNE 18, 2010. Car bombs in northern Iraq kill seven and injure many. Car bombs in two Iraqi cities north of Baghdad have killed seven people and wounded 80 others, police said. The deaths took place in Tuz Khormato, when a bomb exploded outside the home of a local government official. Many of the injured were women and children. Earlier, a bomb targeted the home of a police official in the town of Baquba, in Diyala province, injuring 30 people, including members of his family. [BBC, 6/18/10 ] JUNE 20, 2010. Car Bombs Hit Crowds Outside Bank in Baghdad. A pair of car bombs detonated simultaneously outside Iraq's Bank of Trade on Sunday morning, killing 26 people and wounding 52 others in the second attack on a major government financial institution in eight days. There was no immediate claim of responsibility for the bombing, but the Islamic State of Iraq, an insurgent group with ties to Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, has said it was responsible for a raid at Iraq's Central Bank in Baghdad the previous Sunday that killed 15 people and wounded 50. A separate bombing killed three police officers in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's hometown north of Baghdad. [New York Times, 6/20/10 ] JUNE 17, 2010. Iraqi Sunni Leader and His Family Are Killed in an Ambush. Gunmen with automatic weapons stormed a house outside Falluja on Thursday, killing an Awakening Council member, his wife and three of his children who had all been sleeping in the backyard to escape the summer heat, the authorities said. The Awakening Council member, Khudair Hamad al-Issawi, was apparently a target because he gave security officials information about a planned car bomb attack this month, said Sheik Aifan Sadoon Aifan, a member of the Anbar Province provincial council. The police defused the bomb. [New York Times, 6/17/10 ] JULY 7, 2010. Suicide Bomber Kills At Least 30 Shi'ite Pilgrims in Baghdad. Iraqi security officials say a suicide bomber killed at least 30 people and wounded more than 60 Wednesday after detonating an explosives-filled belt near a crowd of Shi'ite pilgrims. Officials say the attack took place in Adhamiyah, a Sunni district of Baghdad. Investigators say at least five other people were killed in separate bombings in the city, including two other pilgrims. [VOA 7/7/10 ] JULY 18, 2010. Dozens Killed in Suicide Attacks. In the latest high-profile attack against former insurgents who switched sides to fight alongside American forces here, more than 40 were killed Sunday morning after a man detonated himself outside an Iraqi Army base as Awakening members lined up to receive their paychecks. The bomber struck around 8 a.m. on Sunday - the first day of the work week here - in Radwaniya, a largely Sunni neighborhood southwest of central Baghdad. The latest casualty figures from an official at the Ministry of the Interior was 43 killed and 40 wounded. The dead also included Iraqi army soldiers. [New York Times, 7/18/10 ] JULY 20, 2010. Allawi, Sadr meet in Syria to resolve Iraqi government impasse. Pro-Western Iraqi politician Iyad Allawi sought support on Monday to form a government from Iranian-backed cleric Sayyed Moqtada al-Sadr, in the first meeting between the once bitter rivals. Sadr, an anti-US figure who has emerged as a kingmaker in Iraqi politics, did not endorse Allawi but said Allawi had shown more willingness to compromise than Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki, who is trying to cling to power after an inconclusive election in March. Sadr and Allawi met at a hotel in the Syrian capital after they had separately been received by Syrian President Bashar Assad. They later met Turkish Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu, who was on a brief visit to Syria. [Daily Star, 7/20/10 ] JULY 22, 2010. Bomb near Iraq mosque kills 15; U.S. soldier dies in road blast. A car bomb outside a mosque killed at least 15 people and a U.S. soldier was killed in a roadside bombing in separate attacks Wednesday in northern Iraq, American and Iraqi officials said. The two incidents in Diyala province underscored the severity of Iraq's security challenges as U.S. forces prepare to nominally end their combat mission next month and Iraqi politicians continue a months-long fight over who will govern the country. [Washington Post, 7/22/10 ] JULY 22, 2010. In Rare Deadly Attack, Rocket Hits Iraq's Green Zone. A rocket attack on Thursday on the Green Zone, the heavily barricaded section of this city that contains the main government buildings and the United States Embassy, killed three foreign contractors who work for the embassy, and wounded 15, including two American citizens. Casualties are rare in the rocket and mortar attacks directed at the United States Embassy's compound - its largest anywhere, spreading out over more than 100 acres. The contractors, two Ugandans and one Peruvian, were part of a force that guards the embassy and other American government facilities here, according to a statement released late Thursday by the embassy. The statement said, 'This cruel and senseless attack will not deter the United States from carrying out its goal of working with the Iraqi government and people to build a democratic future.' [New York Times, 7/22/10 ] JULY 23, 2010. 4 terror suspects escape from Iraqi prison. Four terror suspects have escaped from a Baghdad, Iraq, prison that was formerly run by U.S. forces, a senior official with the Iraqi justice ministry told CNN Friday. The four men got away on Tuesday and the prison guards who were on duty at the time of the escape have been detained for questioning in an ongoing investigation, the official said. Formerly known as Camp Cropper, the prison was handed over to Iraqi control in mid-July. [CNN, 7/23/10 ] JULY 29, 2010. Iraqi Insurgents Plant Qaeda Flag in Baghdad. In a brazen late-afternoon attack in the heart of this city's most prominent Sunni neighborhood, gunmen struck two police checkpoints on Thursday before a series of roadside bombs detonated on police and army patrols responding to the violence. After the attack - in Adhamiya, a section of Baghdad that was the site of some of the most vicious fighting of the sectarian civil war in 2006 and 2007 - the gunmen raised the black flag of Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, according to a high-ranking Iraqi Army officer. According to an official with the Interior Ministry, the death toll included 6 soldiers and police officers and 10 civilians, while 14 others were wounded. Later, 10 more civilians were injured in a gunfight between insurgents and Iraqi security forces that lasted into the evening and put the neighborhood into a virtual lockdown as the army and police sealed off roads. [New York Times, 7/29/10 ] AUGUST 17, 2010. Power-sharing Talks Between Iraqi Politicians Are Called Off. Negotiations between Iraq's two most powerful political blocs broke down Monday, dashing hopes that a solution to a more than five-month impasse after national elections was on the horizon. The Sunni-and-secular-backed Iraqiya coalition of former Iraqi premier Iyad Allawi called off talks with Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki's Shiite-backed State of Law alliance after the Shiite incumbent called them a 'Sunni' group in an interview. The move by Allawi's group further isolates Maliki, who is intent on staying in power. This month a coalition of Shiite groups also halted talks with Maliki's group. The decision to stop negotiations comes just two weeks before U.S. forces will shrink to 50,000 troops. As the U.S. military discusses the 'end' of the Iraq war, the nation's future is unclear. There is still no government, government office functions are lagging and hundreds are dying in attacks each month. [Washington Post, 8/17/10 ] AUGUST 17, 2010. Iraq Suicide Bomber Targets Iraqi Recruits. In the bloodiest single attack in months, more than 50 people were killed and another 100 were wounded Tuesday morning when an Iraq suicide bomber struck an Army recruiting center in Baghdad. It occurred in the Bab al-Muadham neighborhood of central Baghdad shortly after 7:30 a.m., when a bomber with explosives hidden under his vest blew himself up in a crowd outside the Army's 11th division headquarters. [Christian Science Monitor, 8/17/10 ] AUGUST 31, 2010. Obama Declares an End to Combat Mission in Iraq. President Obama declared an end on Tuesday to the seven-year American combat mission in Iraq, saying that the United States has met its responsibility to that country and that it is now time to turn to pressing problems at home. In a prime-time address from the Oval Office, Mr. Obama balanced praise for the troops who fought and died in Iraq with his conviction that getting into the conflict had been a mistake in the first place. But he also used the moment to emphasize that he sees his primary job as addressing the weak economy and other domestic issues - and to make clear that he intends to begin disengaging from the war in Afghanistan next summer. [New York Times, 8/31/10 ] SEPTEMBER 26, 2010. Iraq's Awakening stripped of their police ranks. Hundreds of police officers, formerly members of an American-backed Sunni paramilitary force, will be stripped of their ranks in the Sunni Arab province of Anbar, tribal leaders and Anbar police said Sunday. The officers called the move by Iraq's Interior Ministry, which oversees police, a threat to security in Anbar, once a stronghold of Sunni insurgent violence. In 2006, a group called the Awakening, some of them former insurgents, rose up with tribal and U.S. backing to battle al-Qaeda in Iraq. The same strategy was mirrored across the country with American backing and funding, and what became the Sons of Iraq is credited with helping calm Sunni Arab areas. In 2007, the U.S. military transformed many of the Awakening members in Anbar into police officers. Now many, such as these 410 men, are being stripped of their ranks, are being targeted by al-Qaeda in Iraq or think the Shiite-led government is trying to get rid of them. [Washington Post, 9/26/10 ] SEPTEMBER 27, 2010. Insurgent Group in Iraq, Declared Tamed, Roars. This spring, United States military commanders said that Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia was a group in disarray, all but finished as a formidable enemy after American and Iraqi troops had killed or captured more than three-quarters of its leaders. But even as officials in the United States and Iraq made public pronouncements that reveled in Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia's demise, the Sunni insurgent group vowed 'dark days colored in blood.' This summer, as if to make good on its pledge, Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia embarked on a wave of terror that managed to shake even an Iraqi public inured to violence: during the past two months, Iraq has witnessed some of its highest casualty tolls in more than two years, according to the government. How Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia has managed this unlikely turnaround - from a near spent force to a reinvigorated threat to Iraq's democracy in a little more than two months - is a puzzle to both the Americans and Iraqis who study the insurgent group, some of whom now wonder whether the organization in Iraq can ever be entirely defeated. [New York Times, 9/27/10 ] OCTOBER 14, 2010. Bomb Hits Politician's Convoy. Iraqi officials said a roadside bomb hit a senior politician's convoy Thursday, killing four people and wounding six others, including the politician. Police and hospital officials say the blast struck the car of the official, Abdul Karim al-Mohammadawi, a member of the Sunni-backed Iraqiya alliance, in Baghdad. The officials say three civilians and a bodyguard were killed. Mr. Mohammadawi, three bodyguards and two bystanders were wounded. [Associated Press, 10/14/10 ] OCTOBER 16, 2010. Sunnis in Iraq Allied With U.S. Rejoin Rebels. Members of United States-allied Awakening Councils have quit or been dismissed from their positions in significant numbers in recent months, prey to an intensive recruitment campaign by the Sunni insurgency, according to government officials, current and former members of the Awakening and insurgents. Although there are no firm figures, security and political officials say hundreds of the well-disciplined fighters - many of whom have gained extensive knowledge about the American military - appear to have rejoined Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia. Beyond that, officials say that even many of the Awakening fighters still on the Iraqi government payroll, possibly thousands of them, covertly aid the insurgency. [New York Times, 10/16/10 ] OCTOBER 18, 2010. Roadside Bomb Kills Baghdad Official. A roadside bomb during the Monday morning rush killed a member of Baghdad's Provincial Council, the local governing body. The explosion, which wounded eight people, is the latest in a stream of small attacks aimed at the police and government officials. American military officials say the modest size of recent attacks, compared with devastating explosions at public buildings one year ago, is evidence of the Iraqi security forces' success in weakening terrorist networks. But the attacks continue to stoke fears of a return to high levels of violence amid the seven-month political stalemate that followed the national elections. [New York Times, 10/18/10 ] OCTOBER 20, 2010. Iraq Prime Minister Visits Egypt and Iran. Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki took his shuttle campaign to Egypt, a predominantly Sunni state that has had warmer relations with Mr. Maliki's main political rival, Ayad Allawi. Mr. Allawi's multisectarian bloc, which includes most of Iraq's Sunnis, won the most seats in the national elections in March, ahead of Mr. Maliki's bloc, which is overwhelmingly Shiite. No alliance captured enough seats to form a new government. At a news conference in Cairo after meeting with President Hosni Mubarak, Mr. Maliki announced that he was seeking 'to involve Egyptian companies in reconstructing Iraq and also to develop political relations,' not to curry support for his bid for re-election. [New York Times, 10/20/10 ] NOVEMBER 1, 2010. Baghdad church hostage drama ends in bloodbath. At least 52 people were killed as security forces stormed a Catholic church in Baghdad to free dozens of hostages, said Deputy Interior Minister Maj Gen Hussein Kamal. He suggested six attackers had also died in the fighting, though other sources have said the overall death toll was lower. The gunmen had reportedly demanded the release of jailed al-Qaeda militants. A statement was posted on a militant website allegedly run by the Islamic State of Iraq, a Sunni militant umbrella group to which al-Qaeda in Iraq belongs, claiming responsibility for the attack. [BBC, 11/1/10 ] NOVEMBER 2, 2010. Coordinated Bombings Strike Across a Tense Baghdad. Insurgents unleashed a deadly series of coordinated attacks in Iraq's capital on Tuesday night, setting off more than a dozen bombs and demonstrating their ability to upend the government's measures to secure the country's largest and most important city. At least 36 people were confirmed dead and more than 300 were wounded, according to the health minister, Saleh al-Hasnawi. The assault was the worst in Iraq since the summer, quickly shattering months of calm. It seemed intended to strike not at security targets or symbols of government power, but at public squares where people gathered to enjoy a clear and mild autumn evening. [New York Times, 11/2/10 ] NOVEMBER 11, 2010. Sunni group walks out of Iraq parliament. The largely Sunni-backed Iraqiya bloc walked out of a critical parliamentary session Thursday to protest what they said was a broken promise by other political blocs. The walkout dealt a setback to what was expected to be a turning point in the impasse that has paralyzed Iraqi politics since inconclusive elections in March. After the departure of Iraqiya, which won the most seats in Iraq's parliament by a slim margin, the remaining 232 lawmakers continued to a presidential vote without them - a move that observers feared could cause a national crisis. Thursday's session had been expected to go smoothly after all major blocs agreed late Wednesday to participate based upon mutual understandings. [Washington Post, 11/11/10 ] NOVEMBER 13, 2010. Iraq lawmakers approve deal to form new government. Iraqi lawmakers approved an agreement on Saturday that aims to bring all of Iraq's feuding political blocs into a new government led by Shiite Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki, although deep disagreements remain about the role to be played by the country's minority Sunnis. The deal struck this week ended an eight-month impasse that had stalled the formation of a new government and threatened to re-ignite sectarian violence. But the agreement appeared on the brink of collapse almost immediately after it was announced because of the deep-rooted distrust that pervades Iraq's sectarian politics. [Associated Press, 11/13/10 ] NOVEMBER 15, 2010. Car bombs kill prison commander in north Iraq. A prison commander and his body guard were killed on Monday when twin car bombs detonated outside a residential complex housing prison guards and staff in northern Iraq, officials said. The Badoosh prison, on the outskirts of Mosul, holds convicted insurgents, al-Qaida militants and criminals from across Iraq. Although it was not immediately clear who was behind the blasts near the prison complex, the facility is known for a poor security record. [Associated Press, 11/15/10 ] NOVEMBER 16, 2010. Gunmen kill 2 Christians in northern Iraq. Gunmen burst into a home in northern Iraq and killed two Christian men as they sat in their living room, continuing a string of attacks again spreading fear through the dwindling religious minority. In a second strike in the city of Mosul on Monday night, assailants bombed another house belonging to a Christian family, wounding a bystander, police and medical officials said Tuesday. [Associated Press, 11/16/10 ] NOVEMBER 19, 2010. Bomb targets Iraq lawmaker from Sunni-backed list. A roadside bomb went off in the northern city of Mosul Friday, narrowly missing a member of a Sunni-backed political bloc but killing one of his bodyguards, Iraqi officials said. There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Sunni Islamic militants often target lawmakers and government officials because they view them as supporting the Shiite-led government. [Washington Post, 11/19/10 ] DECEMBER 13, 2010. Four Killed at Shiite Observance. Four people were killed and more than a dozen were wounded Monday in attacks on three groups of Shiite Muslims observing the religious holiday of Ashura. In the worst attack, a suicide bomber struck the end of a procession in Diyala Province, killing 4 people and wounding 15, mostly women. In Baghdad, a roadside bomb exploded near a procession, wounding four, and three others were hurt in a blast near a Shiite mosque. [New York Times, 12/13/10 ] DECEMBER 15, 2010. Security Council Removes Restrictions on Iraq. The United States, tying up loose ends as its occupation of Iraq winds down, pushed through three Security Council resolutions on Wednesday that lifted restrictions left over from the confrontation with Saddam Hussein. One resolution permits Iraq to develop a civilian nuclear program and import materials once banned because they could possibly be used to help develop unconventional weapons. A second resolution formally shuttered the dormant, widely corrupt oil-for-food program. And the third gives the country control over most of its oil assets starting July 1, 2011, while simultaneously lifting the protection that shielded post-invasion Iraq from countless legal claims.

A spate of bombings killed two Iraqi pilgrims Thursday as they headed to ceremonies to mark a Shiite Muslim day of mourning. Police said four bombs hidden in trash cans killed two people in a procession and wounded six in the town of Dujail, 50 miles (80 kilometers) miles north of Baghdad. The casualties were confirmed by Dr. Munthir Hussein of the Hussein hospital in Dujail. Two more bombs were discovered and disarmed before they exploded, said a local police official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to brief the media. Earlier, a roadside bomb wounded three pilgrims in the downtown Baghdad neighborhood of Karradah, police said. [Associated Press, 12/16/10 ] DECEMBER 21, 2010. Iraq Approves New Government. With a show of hands, a flurry of angry shouts and many unanswered questions, Iraq's Parliament approved a new government on Tuesday, ending nine months of infighting that more than once threatened to throw the nation into a constitutional crisis. In Washington, President Obama called the vote a 'significant moment in Iraq's history' and 'a clear rejection of the efforts by extremists to spur sectarian division.'
