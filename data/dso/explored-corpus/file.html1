Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing
Location
‡ indicates attacks resulting in over 100 deaths
Red indicates the deadliest terrorist attack/s to date
The Islamabad Marriott Hotel bombing occurred during the night of 20 September 2008, when a dump truck filled with explosives detonated in front of the Marriott Hotel in the Pakistani capital Islamabad , killing at least 54 people, injuring at least 266 and leaving a 60 ft (20 m) wide, 20 ft (6 m) deep crater outside the hotel. [4] The majority of the casualties were Pakistanis ; although at least five foreign nationals were killed and fifteen others reported injured. The attack occurred mere hours after President Asif Ali Zardari made his first speech to the Pakistani parliament . [5] The Marriott hotel was the most prestigious hotel in the capital, located near government buildings , diplomatic missions , embassies and high commissions . [6]
During the investigation, three suspected terrorists were arrested by the Pakistani police. They were suspected of having facilitated the suicide bomber. However later they were acquitted of all charges as no evidence was ever presented against them.
A few months after its bombing, the Government of Pakistan had re-constructed the hotel and the Islamabad Marriott reopened officially on 28 December 2008. [7]

The hotel blast caused a severe natural gas leak that set the top floor of the five-story, 258-room hotel on fire, police said. The explosion was heard 15 kilometres away. [8] The blaze that followed quickly engulfed the entire structure of the Marriott hotel. [9] About two-thirds of the building caught fire as a result of the explosion after a natural gas pipe was blown open, and the reception area was completely destroyed. [6] [9] [10] [11] [12]
The owner of the Marriott Hotel, Hashoo Group , [13] owned by Sadruddin Hashwani , who is an Ismaili Muslim , [14] [15] said the truck carrying the bomb had been stopped at the front barrier. "Some shots were fired. One of our guards fired back, and in the meantime the suicide bomber detonated all the explosives. All the guards on the gate died", said Hashwani. [16]
Most of the dead were Pakistani citizens, but foreigners also died from other countries. Two American military personnel [17] and a Danish intelligence agent [18] were killed, and a U.S. State Department employee was missing and presumed dead. [19] The Czech ambassador to Pakistan, Dr. Ivo Žďárek , also died in the ensuing fire along with his Vietnamese companion. Although Žďárek had survived the initial blast, he returned to the hotel to help in the rescue effort but was trapped in the burning building. [20] [21] In addition, six Germans , four Britons and a Filipina receptionist from the hotel [22] were among the injured. [23]
Meeting of the Pakistani leadership[ edit ]
Pakistan's top leaders were to have been in the Islamabad Marriott hotel when it was bombed; instead, having changed their plans at the last minute, they gathered for dinner at the Prime Minister 's house, a few hundred yards from the explosion, following President Asif Ali Zardari maiden address to a joint session of parliament. [24] "The national assembly speaker had arranged a dinner for the entire leadership – for the president, prime minister and armed services chiefs – at the Marriott that day", the Interior ministry head, Rehman Malik, told reporters. [25]
However, the hotel owner, Sadruddin Hashwani, denied that such a meeting had ever been scheduled to take place. [26] According to a spokesman for Hashwani, "We didn't have any reservation for such a dinner that the government official is talking about." [27]
Government advisor Rehman Malik said RDX and TNT were used in the attack. [30] Approximately 600 kg (1,300 lb) of RDX was mixed with TNT ( Torpex or H6 ) and a mixture of mortar and ammunition to increase the explosive capacity. Aluminum powder was also mixed with the material to further enhance this capability. Torpex is about fifty percent more powerful than TNT by weight. [31] The blast was heard for many miles throughout the capital.
"Delay switches" might also have been used. [32] Guards were first alerted by a minor blast, which was followed by the much larger explosion about four minutes later. [26]
Video of the attack[ edit ]
CCTV footage of a six-wheeled dumper truck enters the gates of the Marriott hotel.
The Pakistani government released the CCTV footage of the attack at a press conference saying that a six-wheeled dumper truck filled with explosives and an accelerant pulled up at the gate and first caught fire before exploding a few minutes later. [33] [34]
An unnamed senior security official stated that about 30 U.S. Marines , scheduled to go to Afghanistan , were staying at the hotel, and they were believed to be the targets of the bombing. This conflicted with information given by another unnamed official who stated that the Marines were in Pakistan in connection with the visit by U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen who met the Pakistani Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani and other government officials on Wednesday [35] The personnel were staying on the fourth floor of the hotel, which was also among the most severely damaged by the fire which ensued following the bomb blast. [36] According to the Dawn , a number of the marines who stayed at the hotel sustained injuries; the newspaper also cited an unnamed law enforcement official stating "personnel of a U.S. security agency" were in all likelihood target of the attack. [37] There are also reports that more Americans were present at the hotel, as several senior CIA officers were visiting Islamabad at the time of the attack and believed to be staying at the hotel, according to unnamed "well placed sources". A 29 May 2009 press release from NSA reads: CTM3 Matthew J. O'Bryant, USN, a Navy Cryptologist, was assigned to Navy Information Operations Command (NIOC) Maryland. CTM3 O'Bryant made the ultimate sacrifice on 20 September 2008 while performing a cryptologic mission in Pakistan. The hotel has a direct line of sight to the telecom system in Islamabad Pakistan. [38] The other American soldier killed was Major Rodolfo Ivan Rodriguez, USAF. Major Rodriguez was doing work for the US Embassy and staying at the Marriott at the time of the attack.
Claims of American soldiers breaching security[ edit ]
An MP for the ruling Pakistan Peoples Party , Syed Mumtaz Alam Gillani , has come forward with testimony evidencing a purportedly serious security breach at the Marriott on the night between 16 and 17 September, several days before the bombing. [39] [40] [41] [42] Alam Gillani and two friends are said to have witnessed several large steel boxes being unloaded from a U.S. Embassy truck by a group of U.S. Marines and, according to someone at the hotel, transported to the fourth and fifth floors. [39] [40] Among the several people who witnessed this incident was Pakistan Peoples Party leader Sajjad Chaudhry. [39] However, Alam Gilani was the only one who objected to and protested the apparent security breach taking place, but was met with silence from the American Marines. The hotel security staff did not respond to Alam Gilani's protests as they passively watched what was taking place, not being allowed to go near the boxes by the U.S. Marines. [39] [40] Alam Gillani has since denounced the newspaper account, asserting that he was merely making light conversation with the journalist, however, the newspaper stands by its account. [43] Pakistani authorities are also investigating this issue. [41]
The American Embassy has said that it routinely rents rooms at the Marriott. Confronted with the activities of the U.S. Marines on the night between 16 and 17 September, embassy spokesperson Lou Fintor stated: "A team of support personnel often and routinely precede and/or accompany certain U.S. government officials. They often carry communication and office equipment required to support large delegations, such as high-level administration officials and members of the U.S. Congress." However, the incident occurred after Admiral Mullen's departure. [41]
President Asif Ali Zardari was considering delaying his visit to the US to attend the UN General Assembly session in the wake of the bombing. MP Ayaz Amir said that he felt that the president should cancel his visit given the circumstances, and instead should combat terrorism and extremism. He added, "I believe that the UN General Assembly annual session is the most useless event in the world where leaders go to listen their own speeches." [44] However, Zardari did make it to New York for the opening of the new session of the General Assembly.
Due to the attack, British Airways suspended flights to Islamabad as a precautionary measure "until further notice." [45] American schools and universities in Islamabad has closed rest of the week until further notice has reached.
The BBC reported that Pakistan was an important ally of the United States in its " war on terror ", but that it had disagreements over tactics and had complained about US raids from Afghanistan . [6] Following an apparent power vacuum as a result of the stepping down of former president Pervez Musharraf earlier in the month, U.S. missile-strikes had increased, culminating in the Baghar Cheena airstrike on 17 September. [46] After the event, president Asif Ali Zardari appealed for "all democratic forces" to help to save Pakistan and he pledged to rid Pakistan of Islamic militants: "Terrorism is a cancer in Pakistan, we are determined, God willing , we will rid the country of this cancer. I promise you that such actions by these cowards will not lower our resolve." [6] Pakistan's chief adviser on internal security, Rehman Malik , said "the authorities would fight on until the last terrorist is cleared. We think that the safe Pakistan, safe Afghanistan is safety for the world and therefore we will not let them have easy way." [6]
A Taliban spokesperson denied the group's involvement in the blast, saying they "do not believe in killing so many locals." [47]
An American intelligence official stated that the attack "bears all the hallmarks of a terrorist operation carried out by Al Qaeda or its associates." [12] [28]
Some investigators suspect another Islamist group, Harkat-ul-Jihad-al-Islami , is responsible for the attack based upon the similarities between this incident and four previous attacks allegedly conducted by its operatives. [48]
Dubai -based Arabiya Television says a group calling itself Fedayeen Islam [49] [50] (also spelled Fedayan-i-Islam [51] ), variously translated as "Islamic Commandos" [49] or "Islamic Patriots" [50] has called Arabiya's correspondent in the Pakistani capital, Islamabad. The correspondent said he received a text message on his mobile phone showing a telephone number. He said he called the number and then heard a recording in which the group admitted launching Saturday's attack. The Arabiya television correspondent says the speaker spoke in English language with a South Asian accent. The Fedayeen Islam group has issued several demands including for Pakistan to stop its cooperation with the United States. [50]
Usama al-Kini , one of the suspects who were involved in the hotel attacks.
On 1 January 2009 a missile fired from an unmanned aerial vehicle killed al-Qaeda 's Pakistan operations chief, Usama al-Kini and his aide Sheikh Ahmed Salim Swedan . U.S. officials stated that they believed that al-Kini masterminded the hotel bombing, among other attacks such as the 1998 embassy attacks in East Africa. [52]
The "Islamabad Marriott Assistance Fund" was started by the owner of the hotel as the blast and resulting fires killed about 40 hotel staff, including the security guards who had tried to avert the disaster, while scores of other employees were also wounded.
Sadruddin Hashwani said: "We have set up a fund to cater for the future expenses of the families of employees either killed or wounded in the attack." He announced that he would make an initial donation of US$ 126,000 to the fund, and appealed for people to donate generously. [53]
The Marriott International and The J. Willard and Alice S. Marriott Foundation also made contributions to the fund, established through United Way to provide financial assistance to the associates and their families affected by the tragedy. [54]
A panel that the government had formed, consisting of police officials and experts from security agencies to probe the attack, presented a preliminary report to the Prime Minister. The Interior Secretary Syed Kamal Shah also admitted to the Senate's Standing Committee on his ministry that the blast was the result of a defective security system. He added that the Islamabad police chief has said intelligence agencies had informed the police about an explosive-laden vehicle entering the city to carry out an attack. [24]
Three suspected terrorists Mohammed Aqeel (possibly Dr. Usman), Rana Ilyas and Hameed Afzal were arrested in Peshawar on 17 October by the Pakistani police with connection to the attack were remanded to police custody for 7 days on 18 October for questioning by an anti-terrorism court. They were suspected of having facilitated the suicide bomber. In requesting the court for a 10-day remand, the police also said they hoped to arrest more suspects with information from the three. Judge Sakhi Muhammad Kahut, who remanded the trio to police custody, also ordered police to produce them in court again on 24 October.
Police said that Qari Ishtiaq, who is said to be the commander of Punjabi Tehrik-i-Taliban, was arrested from Bahawalpur on the information provided by the Hijratullah who has been jailed for 10 years due to his role in Lahore police academy attacks . [55] Seven other militants were arrested from different parts of Punjab regions. Four hundred kilograms (880 lb) of explosives were also seized from Qari Ishtiaq. [56]
On 5 May 2010, Mohammed Aqeel , Rana Ilyas, Muhammad Hamid Afzal and Tahseen Ullah were acquitted of all charges as no evidence was ever presented against them. [57]
Vice President Kalonzo Musyoka said, "Clearly, the attacks were not meant for the Kenyan embassy and our citizens are out of danger." He also sent messages of condolences to the people of the country on behalf of his government.
The attack that left the Kenyan embassy in Islamabad damaged. The Permanent Secretary in the Foreign Affairs ministry Mwangi Thuita confirmed the incidence. The blast only shattered windows and doors of the embassy. [81]

Hotels in Boston and to a lesser extent, New York and Washington, D.C., have tightened security in the wake of the bombing attacks near the finish line of the Boston Marathon.
Some are restricting access to guests, others are encouraging guests to stay indoors per police department instructions and still others have stopped accepting checked luggage.
"Starwood Hotels in Boston, New York and Washington have increased security measures," says Starwood spokesman Trey Sarten.
The most obvious security changes are at hotels near the finish line in Boston.
Authorities ordered the evacuation of the luxury Mandarin Oriental hotel, says chain spokeswoman Danielle Devoe.
"As a precautionary measure, they have ordered the evacuation of the hotel," she says. It was still ongoing as of about 6 p.m. The hotel did not have an update on what will happen next, since the situation "is still unfolding," she says.
At the Sheraton hotel, guest Erin Moore, whose husband Jim completed the marathon before the blasts, says they've been instructed not to leave the hotel.
"We've been told the building's on lockdown and they have armed guards out front," she says. Besides, "we have nowhere to go. Everything within a 15-block radius has been closed anyway, we've been told. There' s no point in wandering."
The lobby, she says, was packed with marathon runners who had nowhere else to go after authorities evacuated the streets following the blasts.
The Fairmont Copley Plaza, located two blocks from the finish line, only guests and workers have been allowed to enter the hotel since the bombings, says spokeswoman Lori Holland. Additionally, people entering the hotel had to have their bags searched by the Boston Police.
And per the instructions of Boston Police, those already inside the hotel were encouraged to stay inside, she says. The hotel transformed its St. James Room bar so that people could get in touch with loved ones.
The Wyndham chain has stepped up security in its hotels in Boston as well as New York, says spokeswoman Christine DaSilva.
"Our general managers have notified their teams to be extra vigilant, to not accept checked luggage, and to bring up and report any suspicious activities," she says.
Other hotels won't identify what steps they're taking.
In a statement, Marriott International says it's monitoring the situation closely and "out of an abundance of precaution, have enhanced security measures at our nearby hotels." The company operates eight Marriott-brand hotels and a Ritz-Carlton in the Boston area.
Hilton Worldwide, also in a statement, says that as a precaution it has "increased our security at hotels in the Boston area as well as other properties as appropriate." Hilton declined to disclose details.
The Loews Boston Back Bay Hotel has "taken the appropriate security measures to keep our guests safe as a precaution in response to today's incident," says Lark-Marie Anton, a spokeswoman for the Loews chain.
Some Times Square hotels tighten security
Some New York hotels — especially those in the usually busy Times Square neighborhood — have been beefing up security, too.
The Times Square area after the Boston bombings saw a "seriously stepped up" police presence, says Robert Snyder, president of Tishman Hotel Corp., which owns the InterContinental and Westin hotels in the popular tourist destination.
The two hotels specifically are checking people's key cards before they're allowed to enter the hotel. They're "admitting only registered guests," Snyder says.
The owner of the Doubletree by Hilton hotel in Times Square also is taking extra precautions.
"We are taking all necessary and appropriate steps to ensure the safety of our guests across our portfolio," says Ken Cruse, CEO of Sunstone Hotel Investors, which owns the hotel as well as the Boston Marriott Long Wharf. He declined to specify the additional steps being taken.
But not all Times Square hotels are changing their security procedures.
The Best Western Plus President Hotel is on 48th Street, within walking distance to Times Square, isn't doing anything different, says spokeswoman Laura Cherry. The same is true at the New York Palace hotel, which is farther away from Times Square, near Madison Avenue and 51st Street, says general manager Simon Mais.
Some hotels, airlines waive canceled-trip penalties
Travelers who had planned to visit Boston but changed their mind in light of the deadly blasts may be able to cancel their trip or leave early without paying a change fee.
At this point, three major hotel companies are waiving fees for canceled or changed trips to Boston.
Hilton Worldwide, which runs Hilton, Doubletree and Hampton Inn chains
Starwood, which oversees the St. Regis, Sheraton and Westin chains
Marriott, which runs chains such as Marriott, Courtyard and SpringHill Suites
IHG, the parent of the Holiday Inn, InterContinental and Staybridge Suites chains
Kimpton, which runs three hotels in Boston including the Nine Zero
Fairmont, which runs the Fairmont Copley Plaza

Location
Attack type
The 2002 Bali bombings occurred on 12 October 2002 in the tourist district of Kuta on the Indonesian island of Bali . The attack killed 202 people (including 88 Australians, 38 Indonesians, 27 Britons, 7 Americans, 6 Swedish citizens and 3 Danish citizens). [3] A further 240 people were injured.
Various members of Jemaah Islamiyah , a violent Islamist group, were convicted in relation to the bombings, including three individuals who were sentenced to death . The attack involved the detonation of three bombs: a backpack-mounted device carried by a suicide bomber ; a large car bomb , both of which were detonated in or near popular nightclubs in Kuta; and a third much smaller device detonated outside the United States consulate in Denpasar , causing only minor damage. An audio-cassette purportedly carrying a recorded voice message from Osama Bin Laden stated that the Bali bombings were in direct retaliation for support of the United States' war on terror and Australia's role in the liberation of East Timor . [4]
On 9 November 2008, Imam Samudra , Amrozi Nurhasyim and Huda bin Abdul Haq were executed by firing squad on the island prison of Nusakambangan at 00:15 local time (17:15 UTC).
On 9 March 2010, Dulmatin, nicknamed "the Genius" – believed to be responsible for setting off one of the Bali bombs with a mobile phone – was killed in a shoot-out with Indonesian police in Jakarta. [5]

Fatalities by country
At 23:05 Central Indonesian Time (15:05 UTC) on 12 October 2002, a suicide bomber inside the nightclub Paddy's Pub detonated a bomb in his backpack, causing many patrons, with or without injuries, to immediately flee into the street. Twenty seconds later, a second and much more powerful car bomb hidden inside a white Mitsubishi van was detonated by another suicide bomber outside the Sari Club , located opposite Paddy's Pub. The van was also rigged for detonation by remote control in case the second bomber had a sudden change of heart.[ citation needed ] Damage to the densely populated residential and commercial district was immense, destroying neighbouring buildings and shattering windows several blocks away. The car bomb explosion left a one metre deep crater. [6]
The local Sanglah hospital was ill-equipped to deal with the scale of the disaster and was overwhelmed with the number of injured, particularly burn victims. There were so many people injured by the explosion that some of the injured had to be placed in hotel pools near the explosion site to ease the pain of their burns. Many of the injured were forced to be flown extreme distances to Darwin (1100 miles/1800 km) and Perth (1600 miles/2600 km) for specialist burn treatment.
A comparatively small bomb detonated outside the U.S. consulate in Denpasar , which is thought to have exploded shortly before the two Kuta bombs, caused minor injuries to one person and property damage was minimal. It was reportedly packed with human excrement. [7]
A report released on August 2005 by the United States-Indonesia Society (USINDO) described the events as follows: [8]
The investigators were thus able to recreate the bombers activities. Amrozi, Idris and Ali Imron had simply walked into a dealership and purchased a new Yamaha motorbike, after asking how much they could re-sell it for if they returned it in a few days. Imron used the motorbike to plant the small bomb outside the U.S. Consulate. Idris then rode the motorbike as Imron drove two suicide bombers in the Mitsubishi to the nightclub district in Kuta. He stopped near the Sari Club, instructed one suicide bomber to put on his explosives vest and the other to arm the vehicle bomb. The first bomber headed to Paddy's Pub. Idris then left the second bomber, who had only learned to drive in a straight line, to drive the minivan the short distance to the Sari Club. Idris picked up Imron on the Yamaha and the duo headed back into Denpasar. Idris dialed the number of the Nokia to detonate the bomb at the Consulate. The two suicide bombers exploded their devices. Imron and Idris dropped the motorbike at a place where it eventually attracted the attention of the caretaker.
The final death toll was 202, mainly comprising Western tourists and holiday-makers in their 20s and 30s who were in or near Paddy's Pub or the Sari Club, but also including many Balinese Indonesians working or living nearby, or simply passing by. Hundreds more people suffered horrific burns and other injuries. The largest group among those killed were holidayers from Australia with 88 fatalities. On 14 October, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 1438 condemning the attack as a threat to international peace and security.
Two bodies were never identified and were cremated at Bali in September 2003.[ citation needed ]
There were many acts of individual heroism.
Kusitino 'Kossy' Halemai, a Wallis and Futuna -born Australian citizen who was managing the Bounty Hotel in Kuta at the time of the attacks, sheltered survivors in the immediate aftermath of the blasts. He was singled out for praise with the award of the Medal of the Order of Australia (OAM) on 13 June 2005. [9] [10]
Husband and wife Richard [11] and Gilana Poore, [12] who organised a makeshift triage area in the Bounty Hotel's reception area, were both honoured with an OAM.
James Parkinson, an emergency nurse, worked alongside Doctor Hogg from Wollongong in the Denpasar Sanglah Hospital running the trauma centre for the bombing victims. After disappearing in Africa and Europe for three years, the Governor General 's department finally tracked him down and awarded Parkinson the Medal of the Order of Australia in 2005. [13]
Senior Constable Timothy Britten and Mr Richard Joyes of Western Australia were both awarded the Cross of Valour for their actions during the course of the day. The Cross of Valour is the highest civil honour and is equivalent to the Victoria Cross for Australia which is the highest military honour.
The Mitsubishi L300 van bomb was initially thought to have consisted of C4 , a military grade plastic explosive which is difficult to obtain. However, investigators discovered the bomb was made from potassium chlorate , aluminum powder, and sulfur .[ citation needed ] For the Sari club bomb with the L300 van, the terrorists assembled 12 plastic filing cabinets filled with explosives. The cabinets, each containing a potassium chlorate, aluminum powder, sulfur mixture with a TNT booster, was connected by 150 metres (490 ft) of PETN -filled detonating cord. Ninety-four RDX electric detonators were fitted to the TNT. The total weight of the van bomb was 2,250 pounds (1,020 kg). [14] The large, high-temperature blast damage produced by this mixture was similar to a thermobaric explosive, [15] although the bombers may not have known this. [16]
The organisation suspected of responsibility for the bombing was Jemaah Islamiyah , an Islamist group allegedly led by radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir . [17] [18] A week after the blasts, Arab satellite channel Al-Jazeera put to air an audio-cassette purportedly carrying a recorded voice message from Osama Bin Laden saying that the Bali bombings were in retaliation for support of the United States' war on terror and Australia's role in the liberation of East Timor . [4]
"You will be killed just as you kill, and will be bombed just as you bomb", "Expect more that will further distress you."
The recording did not however claim responsibility for the Bali attack. [4] However, former FBI agent Ali Soufan confirmed that al-Qaeda did in fact finance the attack. [19] In addition, Hambali confessed that al-Qaeda had sent him $US30,000 to fund the bombings of the two nightclubs. [20]
The Indonesian chief of police, General Da'i Bachtiar said that the bombing was the "worst act of terror in Indonesia's history".
Aris Munandar (aka Sheik Aris) is a Jemaah Islamiyah associate linked to Bashir. He is believed to have assisted the Bali bomber Amrozi in acquiring some of the explosives used in the Bali bombings. Philippine intelligence considers Munandar to be associated with Mohammad Abdullah Sughayer, a Saudi national Abu Sayyaf Group in southern Philippines. Munandar is still at large. A report by the United States-Indonesia Society describes the arrest of Amrozi and other suspects. [21]
General Pastika ordered his men to make the arrest early the next morning, November . Amrozi was asleep in the rear of the house. According to Greg Barton's account, Amrozi did not attempt to escape, but laughed instead, later exclaiming, ''Gosh, you guys are very clever, how did you find me?" Amrozi's mobile phone, a particularly important piece of evidence, was seized during his arrest. Bags of chemical ingredients for bombs were found in his workshop and soil samples taken from outside his home showed traces of the primary chemical used in the Sari Club bomb. Police found receipts for the purchase of chemicals used to make the bombs, as well as a list of expenses incurred in making the bombs. Further search of Amrozi's home revealed copies of speeches by Osama bin Laden, and Abu Bakar Bashir, the radical Indonesian Muslim cleric reputed to be the leader of Jemaah Islamiyah. The speeches exhorted listeners to wage jihad. Police also uncovered training manuals on ambush techniques and numerous articles on jihad. Under questioning Amrozi revealed the names of six others involved in the bombing: Ali Imron, Imam Samudra, Dul Matin, Idris, Abdul Ghani and Umar Patek. But Amrozi's mobile phone proved to be the real catch. Indonesian investigators were able to print out a list of calls he had made immediately before, during and after the bombing, as well as the names and telephone numbers in the phone's memory. Pastika kept Amrozi's arrest secret for two days. After it was announced, Polri monitored the sudden flurry of communications among numbers listed in Amrozi's telephone before the calls abruptly ceased. The investigators were able to identify the location of a number of the telephones, leading to a series of arrests.
Indonesian authorities also believe more suspects remain at large. In 2005, Indonesian police arrested 24 additional people suspected of involvement in the Bali attacks and a 2003 bombing of the Marriott Hotel in Jakarta .
On 12 October 2005, a story in Australian broadcaster SBS 's documentary series Dateline , called "Inside Indonesia's War on Terrorism", argued that the Indonesian military or police may have been involved in executing the attack. [22]
On 13 June 2007, it was reported that Abu Dujana , who might have headed a terrorist cell in Bali, was captured. [23]
Just past midnight on 9 November 2008, the three convicted of carrying out the bombings (Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim, and Ali Ghufron) were executed by a firing squad.
Umar Patek was finally arrested in Abbottabad Pakistan in early 2011. [24] The U.S. government had offered a US$1 million reward for his arrest for Patek who is suspected in other bombings as well as the one in Bali.
Initial charges and trials[ edit ]
In April 2003, Indonesian authorities charged Abu Bakar Bashir (also rendered "Ba'asyir"), the alleged spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiyah, with treason . It was alleged that he tried to overthrow the government and set up an Islamic state. The specific charges against Bashir related to a series of church bombings on Christmas Eve in 2000, and to a plot to bomb United States and other Western interests in Singapore . He was initially not charged over the Bali attack, although he was frequently accused of being the instigator or inspirer of the attack. On 2 September, Bashir was acquitted of treason but convicted of lesser charges and sentenced to a prison term of four years. He said he would appeal. On 15 October 2004, he was arrested by the Indonesian authorities and charged with involvement in another bomb attack, which killed 14 people at the J. W. Marriott hotel in Jakarta on 5 August 2003. Secondary charges in this indictment accused him of involvement in the Bali bombing, the first time he faced charges in relation to this attack. On 3 March 2005, Bashir was found not guilty of the charges surrounding the 2003 bombing, but guilty of conspiracy over the 2002 attacks in Bali. He was sentenced to two and a half years imprisonment. The Australian, US, and many governments expressed its disappointment that the sentence was too short; in the outcome, Bashir was freed 14 June 2006 having served less than 26 months for his conspiracy, [25] and on 21 December 2006, Bashir's conviction was overturned by Indonesia's Supreme Court.
On 30 April 2003, the first charges related to the Bali bombings were made against Amrozi bin Haji Nurhasyim, known as Amrozi, for allegedly buying the explosives and the van used in the bombings. On 8 August he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Another participant in the bombing, Imam Samudra , was sentenced to death on 10 September. Amrozi's brother, Ali Imron, who had expressed remorse for his part in the bombing, was sentenced to life imprisonment on 18 September. A fourth accused, Ali Ghufron , the brother-in-law of Noordin Mohammed Top was sentenced to death on 1 October.
Ali Ghufron, alias Mukhlas, told police that he was the head of one of Jemaah Islamiyah's four cells and had ordered the Bali bombings. He also confessed that a fellow leader Riduan Isamuddin, known as Hambali, had provided the funds for the attacks. He told police, I do not know for sure the source of the aforementioned money from Hambali; most probably it was from Afghanistan, that is, from Sheikh Usama bin Laden. As far as I know, Hambali did not have a source of funds except from Afghanistan. Another operative, Wan Min bin Wan Mat, revealed to police that he had given Mukhlas money, at Hambali's request and that he understood part of the money had come directly from al-Qaeda.
As noted below, all three were executed on 9 November 2008. The Australian, US, and many other foreign governments expressed satisfaction with the speed and efficiency with which the Indonesian police and courts dealt with the bombing's primary suspects, despite what they characterized as light sentences. All Australian jurisdictions abolished the death penalty more than 30 years ago, but a poll[ citation needed ] showed that 55% of Australians approved of the death sentences in the Bali cases. The Australian government said it would not ask Indonesia to refrain from using the death penalty.
On 15 August, Riduan Isamuddin , generally known as Hambali, described as the operational chief of Jemaah Islamiyah was arrested in Ayutthaya, Thailand, the old capital one hour's drive north of Bangkok . He is in American custody in the Guantanamo Bay detention camp and has not been charged in relation to the Bali bombing or any other crime.
On 23 July 2004, one of the convicted bombers, Maskur Abdul Kadir, successfully appealed his conviction. He had been tried under retroactive laws which were introduced after the bombing and which were employed to aid the prosecution of those involved in the attack. These laws were used by the prosecution instead of existing criminal laws as they allowed the death penalty to be imposed and lowered certain evidentiary restrictions.
The highest court in Indonesia, the Constitutional Court, found by a margin of five to four that trying the terrorist suspects under these retroactive laws violated Article 28I(1) of the constitution [2]. The minority judges argued that international human rights documents such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights allowed an exception to not applying retrospective legislation in the prosecution of crimes against humanity. The majority found that this argument was inconsistent with the text of Article 28I(1) which states that the rights listed there "cannot be limited under any circumstances."
The bombing site in September 2007
Following this decision, charges related to the bombings against Idris, who had confessed to participating in the attacks to the police and court, were dismissed. The legal status of Kadir, Idris and others who might have their convictions quashed following the ruling on the retrospective law is unclear.
The Constitutional Court is a relatively new body, created after the fall of Suharto , and this decision was one of the first to overrule the constitutionality of the government's application of a law.
Execution of perpetrators[ edit ]
On 24 October 2008, Bali officials announced that three men convicted of carrying out the bombings would be executed by firing squad in November 2008. [26] [27] [28] On 25 October 2008, Communications and Information Minister asked the Indonesian media to stop calling the three heroes. [29]
The Denpasar District Court, on 3 November, accepted a reprieve motion to reconsider the death sentences. [30] [31] Fahmi Bachmid, a lawyer for the family of Jafar Sodiq, a brother of Amrozi and Mukhlas, stated: "We lodged the judicial review to Denpasar court to question (previous) decisions." Lawyer Imam Asmara Hadi stated: "We have lodged an appeal because we haven't received a copy of the Supreme Court rejection of our previous appeal."
Indonesia's Supreme Court denied previous petitions for judicial review amid the constitutional court's dismissal of the bombers' appeals. Denpasar court official Nengah Sanjaya said the 3-page appeal would be sent to a Cilacap , central Java court. But the Attorney General's office said on 1 November the execution was "very close." [32] Supreme Court judge Djoko Sarwoko, however, said a "last-minute legal challenge by the relatives of Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim and Ali Ghufron will not change or delay the execution." They were moved to isolation cells, and execution spots were ready on the Nusakambangan island prison where they are being held. Local chief prosecutor Muhammad Yamin said they will be "executed simultaneously" but at different locations. [33] Imam Samudra, Amrozi Nurhasyim and Ali Ghufron were executed by firing squad after midnight on 9 November 2008 ( West Indonesian time ). [34] In the final moment, there was no remorse or repentance, and they shouted: Allahu Akbar , or "God is great!" [35] For burial, Mukhlas and Amrozi's bodies were flown by helicopter to Tenggulan, Lamongan , East Java , while Imam Samudra's body was flown to Serang , Banten , amid "welcome martyrs" banner displayed at the cemetery. The execution caused high tension and sparked clashes in Tenggulan between hundreds of police and supporters. [36] [37] Indonesian singer and TV presenter Dorce Gamalama attended the funeral of Imam Samudra. After praying with the crowd, she spent half an hour in the house of the executed man and spoke with his mother. On leaving she was quoted as saying "I'm certain he's gone to heaven". [38] Maaruf Amin, deputy chairman of the Indonesian Ulemas Council, the chief body for Islamic clerics in Indonesia said of the men: "They did not die a holy death. That can only be in a war and Indonesia is not at war." [39]
Long Road to Heaven[ edit ]
Peace Park at the former site of the Sari Club
In 2006, Long Road to Heaven , an Indonesian feature film about the bombings was released by Kalyana Shira Films. The film was directed by Enison Sinaro and written by Wong Wai Leng and Andy Logam-Tan. It stars Raelee Hill , Mirrah Foulkes , Alex Komang, Surya Saputra, John O' Hare, Sarah Treleaven, and Joshua Pandelaki.
It tells the story during three different times: the planning a few months before the bombing, its execution in 2002, and the trials in 2003 through the viewpoints of both the victims and the bombers. The story is not chronologically linear, starting with the explosion and then moving from time to time so as all three plots are culminated one after the other. At the beginning of each scene, subtitles tell the date and location of the scene.
List of victims
A permanent memorial was built on the site of the destroyed Paddy's Pub on Legian Street. (A new bar, named "Paddy's: Reloaded", was reopened further along Legian Street). The memorial is made of intricately carved stone, set with a large marble plaque, which bears the names and nationalities of each of those killed. It is flanked by the national flags of the victims. The monument is well-maintained and illuminated at night.
The memorial was dedicated on 12 October 2004, the second anniversary of the attack. The dedication included a Balinese Hindu ceremony and the opportunity for mourners to lay flowers and other offerings. The Australian ambassador and Indonesian officials attended the ceremony.
The Balinese mark their commitment in a nine-day long event. After major cleansing ceremonies, establishing a memorial for the lost lives, and paying respect to those who left loved ones behind, the people of Kuta look forward to restoring Bali's image through an event named "Kuta Karnival — A Celebration of Life". The community event consists of traditional art performances such as Balinese Sunset Dances, sports on the beach as well as in the water for young and old plus rows and rows of culinary displays along the one kilometre of sandy beach.
In line with the return of tourism to Kuta, Kuta Karnival has grown into a tourism promotional event with major coverage from television and newspapers from across the globe. Companies, embassies, Non-Government Organizations, associations and even individuals come forth to get involved in the various events such as a Balinese dance competition presented by a surf-wear company, an environment exhibition presented by an embassy, a fun cycle presented by a group of individuals, a seminar presented by an association and a parade on the streets presented by an NGO. Tourists and locals alike, more than ninety thousand people participates in the numerous events, year after year.
A repeated tragedy in Bali in 2005 did not reduce the Kuta community's determination to carry out this annual event. Kuta Karnival is conducted to commemorate and give respect to the victims of human violence and show the world the true spirit of local community survival despite terrorism attacks.
On 12 October 2010, Australian and Indonesian survivors of the 2002 bombings attended a solemn commemoration service to mark the eighth anniversary of the devastating attacks. [40]
Bali 2002 bombing memorial, Swanston Street, Melbourne
In Lincoln Square (park) on the western side of Swanston Street , Melbourne, Australia , just north of the city blocks, is a memorial representing the 88 Australians who died in the bombings, and notably the 22 from Victoria .
There are 88 jets in the fountain; at night there are lights representing all those who died. The fountain shuts off and becomes a reflecting pool on 12 October each year.
This was one of the very few fountains allowed to operate during the drought in 2007.
Memorial at Kings Park, Perth
A memorial which lists the W.A victims of the bombings was opened on the first anniversary, and is situated on the ridge of Mount Eliza in Kings Park , overlooking the city. The memorial is specifically designed to frame the sun's rays at dawn on 12 October each year and faces in the exact direction of Bali.
An Indonesian-style stone memorial is situated in Allambe Memorial Park at Nerang. A bronze plaque lists the names of the 88 Australians who died in the bombings. An annual twilight service is held at the site of the memorial on each anniversary of the Bali bombings.
On the northern side of Coogee Beach a memorial to the Bali bombing victims comprises three interlocking bronze shapes that have an abstract resemblance to three bowed figures supporting each other. There are also some graffiti memorials in memory of the dead.
The memorial to seven residents of Sutherland Shire who were victims is at Cronulla . Called The Seed, the work is based on the seed and foliage of the Banksia robur , a native plant indigenous to the Shire. This sculpture of pink sandstone is the centrepiece of the memorial. It is set in a black granite pond located in 'Peryman Place' not far from North Cronulla Beach , frequented by many of the seven victims and their families.
Two plaques are set into the granite surrounding the pond. The plaques carry the victims' photos, names, and ages; and also details of the event, the design's symbolism, its dedication, and a poem written by the families of the victims. The work is by sculptor Chris Bennetts and Ishi Buki Sandstone Sculpture. [41]
South of Sydney, in the town of Ulladulla , a large memorial youth centre is being built as a practical and living memorial of Craig Dunn and Danny Lewis, two local (Ulladulla) victims of the bombings. Money is being raised through the Dunn & Lewis Youth Development Foundation. The first stage of the centre is now completed, which includes a 12 lane bowling alley, air conditioned lounge area, food kiosk, and conference room. [42] As soon as financially possible, the second stage will commence, building an auditorium, gymnasium and commence a wide variety of sports and health programs. We aim to complete the commercial kitchen and function rooms to establish additional income streams in this stage. Completion is anticipated by the end of 2012. [43] [44]
A granite cube serves as a memorial in the Eastern Formal Gardens of Parliament House.
List of victims
Prince Charles opened a memorial at the rear of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office headquarters opposite Saint James Park. The memorial consists of a 1.5 metre marble globe, to represent that people from 21 countries were killed, and has 202 doves carved into it. The names of all 202 victims are on a curved stone wall behind the globe. It is the work of artist Garry Breeze and sculptor Martin Cook.
In 2005, two marble wall placards were unveiled at Hong Kong Football Club in memory of the members of the club who were killed in the bombings.
A 130-page comic book about the first Bali Bombing has been launched to promote peace and discourage radicalism and terrorism in Indonesia. The book, titled Ketika Nurani Bicara (When Conscience Speaks), tells about the bombing from the perspective of three people: a volunteer who helped evacuate a bombing victim who lost her husband in the blast; the victim who struggled to raise her children without her husband; and a terrorist who regrets his involvement in the bombing.

The carnage at the Marriott Hotel in Islamabad.
The bombing yesterday at the Marriott hotel in Pakistan's capital of Islamabad is shaping up to be one of the country's most deadly attacks. The complex attack is the latest in a series of al Qaeda attacks that have occurred in the Middle East and South Asia over the last five years.
More than 70 people have been reported killed and 257 have been reported wounded so far in what the Pakistani press has dubbed " Pakistan's 9/11 ." The death toll is expected to rise as more people are believed to have been trapped in the hotel. Dozens of Westerners have been wounded in the attack, and there are unconfirmed reports one or more Westerners have been killed.
The massive blast left a crater 25 foot deep by 20 feet wide. The blast detonated a natural gas line in the hotel, which then set several floors of the hotel ablaze. Several floors of the hotel are still on fire. The hotel is essentially destroyed, there are fears the structure will collapse due to fire and blast damage. Buildings blocks away were heavily damaged.

The attack was well planned and executed. The strike occurred in a so-called secure zone in Islamabad. Two vehicles were involved in the attack, according to Geo TV . A small vehicle breached the outer security barrier. A large dump truck packed with more than one ton of explosives then moved through the breach and detonated at the front of the hotel.
The Taliban may have been gunning for a high-value target. It was believed President Asif Ali Zardari would be visiting the hotel, but he was reportedly nearby when the blast occurred. Reports indicate teams from the US Central Intelligence Agency as well as US Marines were in the hotel at the time of the attack. Western diplomats, tourists, and businessmen favor the five-star hotel. The attack began in the evening after Muslims broke fast for Ramadan, ensuring the restaurants were filled.
The Marriott attack is one of the largest suicide strikes inside Pakistan over the past year, and the second large-scale bombing in over a month. More than 70 Pakistanis were killed and more than 100 were wounded after two suicide bombers detonated their vests nearly simultaneously outside the gates of the Wah military installation on Aug. 21. The Wah facility hosts elements of Pakistan's nuclear weapons program.
The largest attack in Pakistani history occurred in Karachi on Oct. 18, 2007. Suicide bombers killed more than 130 Pakistanis and wounded more than 500 at a rally held to celebrate the return of Benazir Bhutto, the leader of the Pakistani People's Party. A gunman and suicide bomber killed Benazir Bhutto as she campaigned in the military garrison city of Rawalpindi just two months later.
A potent enemy
The attack on the Islamabad Marriott is the latest in series of complex strikes against hardened locations or military formations in the Middle East and South Asia over the last five years by al Qaeda, the Taliban, and their allies. These attacks require logistical and financial support, training, coordination, intelligence gathering, and access to weapons and explosives.
Al Qaeda and allied movements have conducted multiple complex attacks in Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Jordan, Yemen, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. The first strike occurred in Saudi Arabia, before al Qaeda in Iraq even began its insurgency and terror campaign.
Al Qaeda has reformed Brigade 055, the infamous military arm of the terror group made up of Arab recruits, US military and intelligence sources told The Long War Journal in July . The unit is thought to be commanded by Shaikh Khalid Habib al Shami.
Brigade 055 fought alongside the Taliban against the Northern Alliance and was decimated during the US invasion of Afghanistan. Several other Arab brigades have been formed, some consisting of former members of Saddam Hussein's Republican Guards, an intelligence official told The Long War Journal. These units have helped to increase the Taliban's sophistication in military operations in Afghanistan and Pakistan.
A look at some of the more high-profile complex attacks throughout the Middle East and South Asia over the past five years:
Four vehicles, three carrying explosives and two carrying the assault teams breached the gates of three compounds housing Westerners in the capital city. The assault teams breached the gates and the car bombs were driven into the compounds. Thirty-four people, including eight Americans, were killed and more than 160 were wounded.
Dec. 6, 2004
Al Qaeda hits the front gate of the US Consulate in Jeddah. The gate is breached and an assault force stormed the compound. The terrorist took hostages. Six local staff members, a security guard, and three Saudi soldiers were killed .
April 2, 2005
Al Qaeda in Iraq used car bombs in an attempt to breach the wall of a military prison in Abu Ghraib just west of Baghdad. The bombers were followed up by an infantry assault. US Marines repelled the assault, inflicting heavy casualties on the attackers.
April 13, 2005
Al Qaeda in Iraq attempted to breach the walls of a US military outpost on the Syrian border. Three trucks packed with explosives attempted to punch a hole in the outer wall. Al Qaeda then launched an infantry assault. US Marines repelled the attack, inflicting heavy casualties on al Qaeda forces.
June 24, 2005
More than 100 al Qaeda fighters launched an attack on an Iraqi police station in Baghdad. Like the attacks in Abu Ghraib and Husaybah, the attackers used suicide car and truck bombs and followed up with an infantry assault. The Iraqi Police held their ground and defeated the attack.
Oct. 25, 2005
Al Qaeda launched several car and truck bombs in an attempt to breach the wall of the Palestine Hotel in Baghdad. One truck penetrated the perimeter but the driver detonated after it stalled on the road.
Nov. 10, 2005
Three suicide bombing teams penetrated security and struck nearly simultaneously at the Grand Hyatt, the Radisson SAS and the Days Inn in Amman. The attacks occurred during weddings and other events. Fifty-six civilians were killed and 97 were wounded.
Feb. 25, 2006
Al Qaeda operatives in two cars made to look like ARAMCO vehicles got past the first ring of security but were destroyed after being detected and attacked by facility security guards.
Sept. 15, 2006
Two teams of car bombers dressed in military-styled uniforms attempted to destroy two oil installations at the Masila oil field. Security guards repelled the attacks; one came close to destroying a natural gas line and control room.
Feb. 20, 2007
Three al Qaeda suicide car and truck bombs attempt to breach the perimeter of a combat outpost in Tarmiyah. The bombs were followed up by a conventional assault on the compound. The ground assault was repelled but one of the car bombs exploded near the inner wall. This caused a fuel explosion and the collapse of a tower, killing two US soldiers.
Taliban fighters under the command of Baitullah Mehsud captured a Pakistani regular Army company without firing a shot. The Taliban fighters surrounded the convoy as it moved through the tribal agency, and the Army commander surrendered. The soldiers were exchanged for Taliban prisoners.
South Waziristan, Pakistan
January 2008
A large Taliban force estimated at 400 fighters overran a fort manned by the Frontier Corps in the town of Sararogha . The fort was taken after the Taliban breached an outer wall with a truck bomb. Sixteen Frontier Corps paramilitaries were killed and 24 were captured. A large force of Taliban fighters took control of the Saklatoi Fort the next day without firing a shot and conducted several complex attacks on the Lahda Fort but failed to take it.
July 1, 2008
A large Taliban, al Qaeda, and Haqqani Network force launched a complex military attack against a combat outpost in eastern Afghanistan. The Taliban coordinated indirect fire to maneuver its infantry. US and Afghan forces defeated the attack, killing 33 Taliban fighters.
A joint Taliban, Lashkar-e-Taiba, and al Qaeda force launched a complex military attack against a newly built combat outpost in eastern Afghanistan. The enemy force came close to overrunning the outpost. Nine US soldiers were killed in the assault.
Sept. 17, 2008
The Yemeni Islamic Brigades, an al Qaeda affiliate, launched a complex attack against the US Embassy in Sana'a. A car bomb detonated outside the main gate, and then assault teams opened fire on the Yemeni security forces outside the gates. Six terrorists, six Yemeni security guards, and four civilians were killed in the fighting.

i wonder how the pakistani people gonna respond to this
Posted by Raj Kumar at September 21, 2008 6:57 AM ET:
The Pakistani People through their government will respond exactly like they have responded to every other attack by the Paki Taliban and that is too sign more peace deals with the Pakistani Taliban.
I personally think that this was a warning to the President & Prime Minister of Pakistan to lay off the Taliban. Some accounts seem to indicate that the primary target was the PM secretariat and that the hotel was the secondary target when they couldn't get to the Primary.
Pakistan is not Iraq, their will be no uprising here. The Iraqi's for most part are foremost xenophobhic and nationalist first and islamic second. After all they were ruled by what passes for a 'secular' government in their part of the world for most of their histroy.
Pakistan is entirely different story, Pakisatni's have spent the past 60 years chasing after Islam and are now paying the price for it.
Posted by Rhyno327/lrsd at September 21, 2008 10:03 AM ET:
They will most likely blame it on thier gov's ties to the US. This is a no-win situation for the US. Do nothing, and the attacks in A-stan increase, possibly a strike against the West hatched in thier P-stani "safe havens". Now, if the US acts unilaterally, and uses its airpower to destroy the camps, compounds, madrosses, and use Spec. Ops to raid inside the tribal areas, we will STILL catch hell. I would rather be pro-active than sit and let these places operate with impunity. P-stan does not even govern these areas, the T-BAN/AQ do. If it were a court room, the P-stani's case would be weak...if not laughable. How much territory did they cede to these cretins? So, to me, I see it as a free fire zone. Knocking those camps off would probably bring a measure of stability to A-stan. We would be hitting them where they live, and ya can't be in 2 places at one time.

great compilation Bill, I'll bookmark this one.

Look, here's the deal. I am the fartherest thing from an expert in military strategy, or diplomatic strategy either, but enough is enough. It is time for the American military to administer a truly serious strike, or series of strikes on AlQ and the Taliban inside Pakistan. It is time for the American government to show the Pakistani government that we will not tolerate this kind of terrorism against us and our interests, no matter on whose territory it occurs. It is time for the Pakistani government to wake up from their appeasement strategy with the terrorists. It is time for the American government to demonstrate that even during an election campaign we can, and will, take the steps necessary to protect our national interests. It is time that a whole series of co-ordinated strikes on the terrorist bases and safe houses to occur. If that occurs solely with air strikes, or with Spec. Ops. actions mixed in, is not important to me, only that it is time to make it happen. But at my age, there is no chance that I will have to be in harms way either, so I hesitate to opine on this subject. I just think that the Islamic Jihad against America and Israel will continue to escalate until we make them pay a price that is truly significant, and that means that we will see more of our citizens killed and maimed then if we bite the bullet and do what we must do now, and may God bless whatever actions we take and the warriors involved therein.

Just watching the Pakistan government in action under normal conditions is example of confusion. A decapitation strike may shatter the chain of control on nuclear weapons. In confusion there is opportunity. Are the bad guys setting the conditions to acquire a Pak nuclear device? Why try to build one when the parts are in your neighborhood.

The Marriott Hotel chain needs to move the hotel to a more appropriate site with sufficient "set back" and/or distance from the street. Trucks should be banned from the site.
Posted by Private Finch at September 22, 2008 8:59 AM ET:
Pakistan has allowed the border to be turned into a 'free fire zone' and now they are paying the price for foolish apeasement with the T-ban. Now the T-ban have moved into this zone P-stan have given them. Pakistan in now having the worst of both worlds - an out of control T-ban infested border and the US going after combatants given sanctuary in P-stan. Pakistan has spent too much time being focused on India and forgotten the growing Islamic problem.
Posted by Neo at September 22, 2008 9:26 AM ET:
We'll have to see if this bombing has any effect on the Pakistani governments offensive in Bajaur. This hits very close to home. One might expect it both stiffens the resolve and underlines the seriousness of the situation for Pakistan's leadership.

Hi Bill,
I am little dissappointed with this report. Only a day before as per MNA of PPP who was having dinner inside the hotel, a white van brought some marines who carried some heavy steel boxes to 4th and 5ht floor of the hotel.The marines carried the boxes themselves and didnot allow the Xray scanners to scan them.The MNA informed the hotel security who have already blocked the entrance for this ooperation.Now the brother of this MNA who is a journalist checked in to find out more.
1.Now the dumper truck was not allowed to enter the hotel and the crater was formed outside.
2.But fire catches ONLY on 4th and 5th floor only due to gas leak as per report.This is very suspicious.
3,.From the pictures i find that the hotel was burning from 4th floor up.
to me it looks like an insider operation by some high profile operative who wanted to get hold of those steel boxes.
One CIA and Danish intelligence operative are still missing and their bodies are not found.To me it looks like some body kidnapped these guys and took away the boxes if they are of high value.
suddenly there were blogs blaming Indian RAW for the operation
A very mysterious operation by whoever done it.

The Pakistani landscape has changed. One Pak leader said "this is Pakistan's 9/11." Thus, the political door is open and the time to strike is now.
Posted by My2cents at September 22, 2008 7:56 PM ET:
"The massive blast left a crater 25 foot deep by 20 feet wide"
I am not an expert, but this does not sound right. Shouldn't the crater be several times wider than it's depth?
Posted by My2cents at September 22, 2008 8:18 PM ET:
The article linked on the sidebar gave the correct dimensions of the crater "24 feet deep and 59x63 feet in diameter". That makes sense.

It don't know which pictures you're looking at, but the pictures in the article show flames coming out the windows on the 2nd floor.
The flames DO reach the 5th floor but, given that flames travel up rather than down, it is more likely the fire started near the ground and moved up.

The United States presidential election of 2008 was the 56th quadrennial presidential election . It was held on Tuesday, November 4, 2008. Democratic Party nominee Senator Barack Obama and running mate Senator Joe Biden defeated Republican Party nominee Senator John McCain and running mate Governor Sarah Palin .

Early campaigning had focused heavily on the Iraq War and the unpopularity of outgoing Republican President George W. Bush , but all candidates focused on domestic concerns as well, which grew more prominent as the economy experienced the onset of the Great Recession and a major financial crisis that peaked in September 2008 .
Obama would go on to win a decisive victory over McCain, winning both the popular vote and the electoral college , with 365 electoral votes to McCain's 173; he received the largest percentage of the popular vote for a Democrat in nearly a half-century . Obama's successes in obtaining a major party's nomination and winning the general election were both firsts for an African American . Although Hillary Clinton did not win the Democratic nomination, she was the first woman to win a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection when she won the primary in New Hampshire on January 8. [2] [3] [nb 1] She also was the first woman to be an American presidential candidate in every primary and caucus in every state. [6] Similarly, Sarah Palin became the first woman to appear on a Republican presidential ticket, and the second woman overall to appear on a major party's presidential ticket (after Geraldine Ferraro in 1984 ).
This was notable as the first election since 1952 where neither of the two major candidates were either the incumbent president or vice president. Obama's total vote amount of 69.5 million votes is the highest amount ever won by a presidential candidate. The total of 131 million votes cast in the election represents over 43% of the total U.S. population, the highest share of any presidential election in U.S. history. [7] [8]

In 2004 , President George W. Bush won reelection , defeating the Democratic nominee, Senator John Kerry . After Republican pickups in the House and Senate in the 2004 elections, Republicans maintained control of the executive and legislative branches of the federal government.
Bush's approval ratings had been slowly declining from their high point of almost 90% after 9/11 , [9] and they were barely 50% by his reelection. Although Bush was reelected with a larger Electoral College margin than in 2000 , during his second term, Bush's approval rating dropped more quickly, with the Iraq War and the federal response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 being most detrimental to the public's perception of his job performance. [10] [11]
By September 2006, Bush's approval rating was below 40%, [12] and in the November United States Congressional elections 2006 , Democrats gained the majority in both houses. Bush's approval ratings dropped for the last two years in office to the 25–37% range. [13] [14] [15]
In the United States, there are two major political parties , the Democratic Party and the Republican Party . There are also several minor parties, usually called third parties, though most media and public focus is on the two major parties.
Each major party hosts candidates who go through a nomination process to determine the presidential nominee for that party. The nomination process consists of primaries and caucuses, held by the 50 states, as well as Guam , Puerto Rico , Washington, D.C. , U.S. Virgin Islands , American Samoa , and the Northern Mariana Islands . The winner of each of these primary elections usually receives delegates proportional to the percentage of the popular vote that candidate received in each states. In many Republican primaries, all the state's delegates are awarded to the winning candidate. In the Democratic Party, high-ranking party members known as superdelegates each receive one vote in the convention. Whichever candidate has the majority of the delegates at the end of the primary elections is designated the presumptive nominee until he or she is formally nominated and endorsed for the presidency by his or her political party. This is done by the aforementioned delegates for each party.

Before the primaries[ edit ]
Media speculation had begun almost immediately after the results of the 2004 presidential elections became known. In the 2006 midterm elections , the Democrats regained majorities in both houses of Congress . [16] Early polls taken before anyone had announced a candidacy had shown Senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama as the most popular potential Democratic candidates. [17] Nevertheless, the media speculated on several other candidates, including Al Gore , the runner-up in the 2000 election ; John Kerry , the runner-up in the 2004 election ; John Edwards , his running mate ; Delaware Senator Joseph Biden; New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson; Iowa Governor Tom Vilsack; and Indiana Senator Evan Bayh. [18]
Edwards was one of the first to formally announce his candidacy for the presidency, on December 28, 2006. This run would be his second attempt at the presidency. [19] Clinton announced intentions to run in the Democratic primaries on January 20, 2007. [20] Obama announced his candidacy on February 10 in his home state of Illinois. [20] None of the candidates received a significant bounce in their poll numbers after their official announcements. [21] Through most of 2007, even after it was evident Al Gore would not run, John Edwards and Al Gore each hovered between the third and fourth place spots in the polls behind Clinton and Obama. [22]
"Front-runner" status is dependent on the news agency reporting, and by October 2007, the consensus listed the three aforementioned candidates as leading the pack after several debate performances. The Washington Post listed Clinton, Edwards and Obama as the front runners, "leading in polls and fundraising and well ahead of the other major candidates". [23] Clinton led in nearly all nationwide opinion polling until January 2008. [22]
Comedian Stephen Colbert mounted his own campaign for the nomination in his home state of South Carolina , announcing it in October 2007. [24] Public Opinion Strategies conducted a poll and found Colbert nationally in fifth place at 2.3% behind Joe Biden's 2.7%. [25]
The early primaries and caucuses are considered the most critical of nomination process. Most candidates lacking support drop out after doing poorly in the Iowa caucuses and New Hampshire primary , and these states' results often shift national preferences, according to historical polling data. [26] The states that hold early primaries and caucuses are, chronologically, Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, and South Carolina. In 2008, Florida and Michigan moved their primaries into January against the Democratic Party's rules, and the results of these primaries were discounted and disputed until after the rest of the contests occurred. [27]
At the start of the year, support for Barack Obama began rising in the polls, passing Clinton for first place in Iowa; Obama ended up winning the Iowa caucus, with John Edwards coming in second and Clinton in third. [28] Obama's win was fueled mostly by first time caucus-goers and Independents and showed voters viewed him as the candidate of change. [28] Iowa is viewed as the state that jump-started Obama's campaign and set him on track to win the nomination and the presidency. [29] After the Iowa caucus, Joe Biden and Christopher Dodd withdrew from the nomination contest. [28]
Obama became the new front runner in New Hampshire when his poll numbers skyrocketed after his victory in Iowa. [30] The Clinton campaign was struggling after a bad loss in Iowa and no strategy beyond the early primaries and caucuses. According to The Vancouver Sun , "Campaign strategists had mapped a victory scenario that envisioned the former first lady wrapping up the Democratic presidential nomination by Super Tuesday on Feb. 5." [31] In what is considered a turning point for her campaign, Clinton had a strong performance at the Saint Anselm College , ABC and Facebook debates several days before the New Hampshire primary as well as an emotional interview in a public broadcast live on TV. [32] Clinton won that primary by 2% of the vote, contrary to the predictions of pollsters who consistently had her trailing Obama for a few days up to the primary date. [30] Clinton's win was the first time a woman had ever won a major American party's presidential primary for the purposes of delegate selection. [33] (Shirley Chisholm's prior "win" in New Jersey in 1972 was in a no-delegate-awarding, presidential preference ballot that the major candidates were not listed in and that the only other candidate who was listed had already withdrawn from; the actual delegate selection vote went to George McGovern . [34] [35] )
On January 30, 2008, after placing in third in the New Hampshire and South Carolina primaries, Edwards announced that he was suspending his campaign for the presidency, but he did not initially endorse any remaining candidate. [36] [37]
Super Tuesday occurred on February 5, 2008, during which the largest-ever number of simultaneous state primary elections was held. [38] Super Tuesday ended up leaving the Democrats in a virtual tie, with Obama amassing 847 delegates to Clinton's 834 from the 23 states that held Democratic primaries. [39]
Earlier, on February 3 on the UCLA campus, celebrities Oprah Winfrey , Caroline Kennedy and Stevie Wonder , among others, made appearances to show support for Barack Obama in a rally led by Michelle Obama . [40] In addition, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger 's wife at the time, Maria Shriver , endorsed Obama. [41] California was one of the Super Tuesday states that were rich in delegates. Obama trailed in the California polling by an average of 6.0% before the primary; he ended up losing the state by 8.3%. [42] Some analysts cited a large Latino turnout that voted for Clinton as the deciding factor. [43]
Louisiana , Nebraska , Hawaii , Wisconsin , U.S. Virgin Islands , the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia primaries and the Washington and Maine caucuses all took place after Super Tuesday in February. Obama won all of them, giving him ten consecutive victories after Super Tuesday. [44] [45]
Ohio, Texas, and Pennsylvania[ edit ]
On March 4, Hillary Clinton carried Ohio and Rhode Island in the Democratic primaries; some considered these wins, especially Ohio, a surprise upset, [46] although she led in the polling averages in both states. [42] [47] She also carried the primary in Texas , but Obama won the Texas caucuses held the same day and netted more delegates from the state than Clinton. [48]
Only one state held a primary in April. This was Pennsylvania , on April 22. Although Obama made a strong effort to win Pennsylvania, Hillary Clinton won the primary by nearly 10%, with approximately 55% of the vote. [49] Obama had outspent Clinton three to one in Pennsylvania, but his comment at a San Francisco fundraiser that small-town Americans "cling" to guns and religion drew sharp criticism from the Clinton campaign and may have hurt his chances in the Keystone State. [50] In addition, Clinton had several advantages in Pennsylvania. Throughout the primary process, she relied on the support of older, white, working class voters. Pennsylvania held a closed primary, which means that only registered Democrats could vote, and, according to Ron Elving of NPR , "The established Democratic electorate was older, whiter, more Catholic and more working-class than in most of the primaries to date." [51] After Pennsylvania, Obama had a higher number of delegates and popular votes than Clinton did and was still in a stronger position to win the nomination. Clinton, however, had received the endorsement of more superdelegates than Obama. [49]
Indiana and North Carolina[ edit ]
On May 6, North Carolina and Indiana held their Democratic presidential primaries. Clinton and Obama campaigned aggressively there before the voting took place. The candidates acknowledged the importance of these primaries and said they were turning point states that could make or break either of their campaigns. [52] Polling had shown Obama a few points ahead in North Carolina and Clinton similarly leading in Indiana. [53] [54] In the actual results, Obama outperformed the polls by several points in both states, winning by a significant margin in North Carolina [55] and losing by only 1.1% in Indiana (50.56% to 49.44%). [56] After these primaries, most pundits declared that it had become increasingly improbable, if not impossible, for Clinton to win the nomination. [57] The small win in Indiana barely kept her campaign alive for the next month. [58] Although she did manage to win the majority of the remaining primaries and delegates, it was not enough to overcome Obama's substantial delegate lead.
Scandal surrounded the primary in Indiana because a Democratic State Committee member and county chair led a forgery ring to get all of the Democratic candidates on the ballot. [59] This Democratic State Committee member, Owen "Butch" Morgan was convicted of felonies regarding the forgeries and sentenced to a year in prison, community corrections, and probation. [60]
All Democratic presidential candidates needed, under Indiana law, 500 signatures per congressional district. Owen "Butch" Morgan, Democrat county chair, congressional district chair, and State Committee member, was convicted as the leader. Congressional candidate Andrew Straw [61] called on Morgan to resign in May 2011 over inaccessibility of the Democratic headquarters in South Bend, but he resigned instead over the petition forgery indictment. [62] [63] Straw is now the state chair of the Disability Party in Indiana. [64]
Florida and Michigan[ edit ]
During late 2007, the two parties adopted rules against states' moving their primaries to an earlier date in the year. For the Republicans, the penalty for this violation was supposed to be the loss of half the state party's delegates to the convention. The Democratic penalty was the complete exclusion from the national convention of delegates from states that broke these rules. The Democratic Party allowed only four states to hold elections before February 5, 2008. Initially, the Democratic leadership said it would strip all delegates from Florida and Michigan , which had moved their primaries into January. In addition, all major Democratic candidates agreed officially not to campaign in Florida or Michigan, and Edwards and Obama removed their names from the Michigan ballot. Clinton won a majority of delegates and popular votes from both states (though 40% voted uncommitted in Michigan) and subsequently led a fight to seat all the Florida and Michigan delegates. [65]
Political columnist Christopher Weber noted that while her action was self-serving, it was also pragmatic to forestall Florida or Michigan voters becoming so disaffected they did not vote for Democrats in the general election. [66] There was some speculation that the fight over the delegates could last until the convention in August. On May 31, 2008, the Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic Party reached a compromise on the Florida and Michigan delegate situation. The committee decided to seat delegates from Michigan and Florida at the convention in August, but to only award each a half-vote. [67]
Clinching the nomination[ edit ]
Technically the nomination process for major political parties continues through June of election year. In previous cycles the candidates were effectively chosen by the end of the March primaries. In this cycle, Barack Obama did not win enough delegates to secure the nomination until June 3, after a 17-month-long campaign against Hillary Clinton. Obama had a wide lead in states won, while Clinton had won majorities in several of the larger states. Because a form of proportional representation and popular vote decided Democratic state delegate contests, numbers were close between Clinton and Obama. [68] By May, Clinton claimed to hold a lead in the popular vote, but the Associated Press found her numbers accurate only in one close scenario. [69]
In June, after the last of the primaries had taken place, Obama secured the Democratic nomination for President, with the help of multiple super delegate endorsements (most of the super delegates had refused to declare their support for either candidate until the primaries were completed). [70] He was the first African American to win the nomination of a major political party in the United States. [71] For several days, Clinton refused to concede the race, although she signaled her presidential campaign was ending in a post-primary speech on June 3 in her home state of New York. [72] She finally conceded the nomination to Obama on June 7. She pledged her full support to the presumptive nominee and vowed to do everything she could to help him get elected. [73]

Before the primaries[ edit ]
Immediately after the 2006 midterm elections, media pundits began speculating, as they did about the Democrats, about potential Republican candidates for President in 2008. [17] In November 2006, Former New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani led in the polls, followed closely by Arizona Senator John McCain . [76] The media speculated that Giuliani's pro-choice stance on abortion and McCain's age and support of the unpopular Iraq War would be detriments to their candidacies. [17] Giuliani remained the frontrunner in the polls throughout most of 2007, with McCain and former Tennessee Senator Fred Thompson fighting for second place. [77] Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee , Giuliani, Former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney , and Texas Congressman Ron Paul announced their candidacies on January 28, February 5, February 13, and March 12, respectively. [78] [79] [80] [81] McCain officially announced his candidacy on March 1, 2007, after several informal announcements. [82] In the third quarter of 2007, the top four GOP (Republican) fundraisers were Romney, Giuliani, Thompson, and Ron Paul . [83] MSNBC's Chuck Todd christened Giuliani and John McCain the front runners after the second Republican presidential debate in early 2007. [84]
Huckabee, after winning in Iowa, had little money and hoped for a third-place finish in New Hampshire. McCain eventually displaced Rudy Giuliani and Romney as the front runner in New Hampshire . McCain staged a turnaround victory, [85] having been written off by the pundits and polling in single digits less than a month before the race. [86]
With the Republicans stripping Michigan and Florida of half their delegates for moving their primaries into January 2008 against party rules, the race for the nomination was based there. McCain meanwhile managed a small victory over Huckabee in South Carolina , [87] setting him up for a larger and more important victory over Romney in Florida , which held a closed primary on January 29. [88] By this time, after several scandals, no success in the early primaries, and a third-place finish in Florida, Giuliani conceded from the nomination race and endorsed John McCain the next day. [89]
McCain was also endorsed in February by California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger before the California primary took place on Super Tuesday. This gave him a significant boost in the polls for the state's primary, [90] which awarded the greatest number of delegates of all the states. On Super Tuesday, McCain won his home state of Arizona, taking all 53 delegates. He also won nearly all of California's 173 delegates, the largest of the Super Tuesday prizes. McCain also scored wins in seven other states, picking up 574 delegates. [91] Huckabee was the "surprise performer", winning 5 states and 218 delegates. [91] Romney won 7 states and 231 delegates. [91] Two days later, Romney suspended his presidential campaign, saying that if he stayed in the race, he would "forestall the launch of a national campaign and be making it easier for Senator Clinton or Obama to win". [92] His departure left Huckabee and Paul as McCain's only major challengers in the remaining primaries and caucuses. Romney endorsed McCain on February 14. [93]
Louisiana, Washington, Kansas , Wisconsin , and Washington held primaries in February after Super Tuesday. Despite McCain picking up big victories, Huckabee won Louisiana and Kansas. McCain narrowly carried the Washington caucuses over Huckabee and Paul, who amassed a large showing. [45] The Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico closed February for the Republicans. After Super Tuesday, John McCain had become the clear front runner, but by the end of February, he still had not acquired enough delegates to secure the nomination. In March, John McCain clinched the Republican nomination after sweeping all four primaries, Texas , Ohio , Vermont , and Rhode Island , putting him over the top of the 1,191 delegates required to win the GOP nomination. [47] Mike Huckabee then conceded the race to McCain, leaving Ron Paul, who had just 16 delegates, as his only remaining opponent. [94]
Along with the Democratic and Republican parties, three other parties nominated candidates with ballot access in enough states to win the minimum 270 electoral votes needed to win the election. These were the Constitution Party , the Green Party , and the Libertarian Party . In addition, independent candidate Ralph Nader ran his own campaign.
The Green Party nominated former Democratic Congresswoman Cynthia McKinney of Georgia for President, and political activist Rosa Clemente from New York for Vice President. McKinney campaigned on a platform that supported single-payer universal health care , the withdrawal of American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan, reparations for African Americans, and the creation of a Department of Peace. [98]
The Libertarian Party nominated former Republican Congressman Bob Barr of Georgia for President, and his former rival for the Libertarian nomination Wayne Allyn Root of Nevada, for Vice President. During the 2008 presidential campaign, Barr advocated a reworking or abolishment of the income tax [99] and opposed the war in Iraq [100] and the Patriot Act . [101]
Sites of the 2008 National Party Conventions
General election campaign[ edit ]
An issue in the election was Obama's possible, [102] [103] [104] and then actual, [105] [106] nomination by the Democratic Party. On August 28, 2008, when Obama formally accepted the Democratic nomination for President, he became the first African American to be nominated for President by a major political party. [105] The television audiences for both McCain's and Obama's acceptance speeches broke records, according to Nielsen ratings . [107]
The unpopular war in Iraq was a key issue during the campaign before the economic crisis . John McCain supported the war while Barack Obama opposed it. (Obama's early and strong opposition to the war helped him stand out against the other Democratic candidates during the primaries, as well as stand out to a war-weary electorate during the general campaign). Though McCain meant it as a peacetime presence like the United States maintained in Germany and Japan after World War II , [108] his statement that the United States could be in Iraq for as much as the next 50 to 100 years would prove costly. Obama used it against him as part of his strategy to tie him to the unpopular President Bush.
John McCain's support for the troop 'surge' employed by General David Petraeus , which was one of several factors credited with improving the security situation in Iraq, may have boosted McCain's stance on the issue in voters' minds. McCain (who supported the invasion) argued that his support for the successful surge showed his superior judgment. However, Obama was quick to remind voters that there would have been no need for a "surge" had there been no war at all, thus questioning McCain's judgment.
George W. Bush had become increasingly unpopular by 2006. Polls consistently showed that about 30 percent of the American public approved of his job performance. [13] [109] [110] In March 2008, Bush endorsed McCain at the White House, [111] but Bush did not make a single appearance for McCain during the campaign. Bush appeared at the 2008 GOP convention only through a live video broadcast. He chose not to appear in person due to disaster events in the Gulf of Mexico in the aftermath of Hurricane Gustav . Although he supported the war in Iraq, McCain made an effort to show that he had disagreed with Bush on many other key issues such as climate change. During the entire general election campaign, Obama countered by pointing out in ads and at numerous campaign rallies that McCain had claimed in an interview that he voted with Bush 90% of the time, and congressional voting records supported this for the years Bush was in office. [112]
Change vs. experience[ edit ]
Before the Democratic primaries began, the dichotomy of change versus experience had already become a common theme in the presidential campaign, with Senator Hillary Clinton positioning herself as the candidate with experience and Obama embracing the characterization as the candidate most able to bring change to Washington. Before the official launch of her campaign , aides for Clinton were already planning to position her as the 'change' candidate, as strategist Mark Penn made clear in an October 2006 memo titled "The Plan." [113] In his presidential run announcement, Obama framed his candidacy by emphasizing that "Washington must change." [114] In response to this, Clinton adopted her experience as a major campaign theme. [115] By early and mid-2007, polls regularly found voters identifying Clinton as the more experienced candidate and Obama as the "fresh" or "new" candidate. [116] [117] Exit polls on Super Tuesday found that Obama won voters who thought that the ability to bring change was the most important quality in a candidate, who made up a majority of the Democratic electorate. By a margin of about 2-1, Clinton was able to make up for this deficiency by an almost total domination among voters who thought experience was the most important quality. [118] These margins generally remained the same until Obama clinched the Democratic nomination on June 3.
Obama campaigning as a symbol of change in Cleveland , Ohio with a "Change We Need" sign
Obama's promised "universal health care, full employment, a green America, and an America respected instead of feared by its enemies". [119] He used new media to "form a bond with his supporters" which helped him "appeal to the youth audience's need to feel special, in-the-know, empowered and special". This was best displayed in his text message announcement of Joe Biden as the vice-presidential candidate. [120] He has also declared, in his book The Audacity of Hope , that he did not experience a religious upbringing. Rather he developed his faith due to the church's ability to motivate social change. [121] Bowdern wrote, "This is best exemplified in his "50 state strategy", where he campaigned in states that historically would never vote for a Democrat. The 2008 presidential election saw a large youth turn out, up to 51%." [122]
John McCain quickly adopted similar campaign themes against Obama at the start of the general election campaign. Polls regularly found the general electorate as a whole divided more evenly between 'change' and 'experience' as candidate qualities than the Democratic primary electorate, which split in favor of 'change' by a nearly 2-1 margin. [123] Advantages for McCain and Obama on experience and the ability to bring change, respectively, remained steady through the November 4 election. However, final pre-election polling found that voters considered Obama's inexperience less of an impediment than McCain's association with sitting President George W. Bush, [124] an association which was rhetorically framed by the Obama campaign throughout the election season as "more of the same".
McCain appeared to undercut his line of attack by picking first-term Alaska governor Sarah Palin to be his running mate. [125] Palin had been governor only since 2006, and before that had been a council member and mayor of Wasilla . Nonetheless, she excited much of the conservative base of the GOP with her speech at the 2008 Republican National Convention , a group that was initially lukewarm toward McCain's candidacy. [126] However, media interviews suggested that Palin lacked knowledge on certain key issues, and they cast doubt among many voters about her qualifications to be Vice President or President. [127] Because of Palin's conservative views, there was also concern that she would alienate independents and moderates, two groups that pundits observed McCain would need to win the election. [128]
Polls taken in the last few months of the presidential campaign and exit polls conducted on Election Day showed the economy as the top concern for voters. [129] [130] In the fall of 2008, many news sources were reporting that the economy was suffering its most serious downturn since the Great Depression . [131] During this period, John McCain's election prospects fell with several politically costly comments about the economy.
On August 20, John McCain said in an interview with Politico that he was uncertain how many houses he and his wife, Cindy, owned; "I think—I'll have my staff get to you." [132] Both on the stump and in Obama's political ad, "Seven", the gaffe was used to portray McCain as unable to relate to the concerns of ordinary Americans. This out-of-touch image was further cultivated when, on September 15, the day of the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy , at a morning rally in Jacksonville, Florida, McCain declared that "the fundamentals of our economy are strong," despite what he described as "tremendous turmoil in our financial markets and Wall Street." [133] With the perception among voters to the contrary, the comment appeared to cost McCain politically.
On September 24, 2008, after the onset of the 2008 financial crisis , McCain announced that he was suspending his campaign to return to Washington to help craft a $700 billion bailout package for the troubled financial industry, and he stated that he would not debate Obama until Congress passed the bailout bill. [134] Despite this decision, McCain was portrayed as not playing a significant role in the negotiations for the first version of the bill, which fell short of passage in the House. He eventually decided to attend the first presidential debate on September 26, despite Congress' lack of immediate action on the bill. His ineffectiveness in the negotiations and his reversal in decision to attend the debates were seized upon to portray McCain as erratic in his response to the economy. Days later, a second version of the original bailout bill was passed by both the House and Senate, with Obama, his vice presidential running mate Joe Biden , and McCain all voting for the measure (Hillary Clinton would as well). [135]
All the aforementioned remarks and campaign issues hurt McCain's standing with voters. All these also occurred after the economic crisis and after McCain's poll numbers had started to fall. Although sound bites of all of these "missteps" were played repeatedly on national television, many pundits and analysts say that the actual financial crisis and economic conditions caused McCain's large drop in support in mid-September and severely damaged his campaign. [136] [137]
John McCain 's proposals focused on open-market competition rather than government funding or control. At the heart of his plan were tax credits – $2,500 for individuals and $5,000 for families who do not subscribe to or do not have access to health care through their employer. To help people who are denied coverage by insurance companies due to pre-existing conditions, McCain proposed working with states to create what he calls a "Guaranteed Access Plan". [138]
Barack Obama called for universal health care . His health care plan proposed creating a National Health Insurance Exchange that would include both private insurance plans and a Medicare-like government run option. Coverage would be guaranteed regardless of health status, and premiums would not vary based on health status either. It would have required parents to cover their children, but did not require adults to buy insurance.
The Philadelphia Inquirer reported that the two plans had different philosophical focuses. They described the purpose of the McCain plan as to "make insurance more affordable," while the purpose of the Obama plan was for "more people to have health insurance." [139] The Des Moines Register characterized the plans similarly. [140] The Commonwealth Fund concluded that, compared with McCain's approach, Obama's plan could provide more people with affordable health insurance that covers essential services, achieve greater equity in access to care, realize efficiencies and cost savings in the provision of coverage and delivery of care, and redirect incentives to improve quality. [141]
Critics of McCain's plan argued that it would not significantly reduce the number of uninsured Americans, would increase costs, reduce consumer protections and lead to less generous benefit packages. [142] Critics of Obama's plan argued that it would increase federal regulation of private health insurance without addressing the underlying incentives behind rising health care spending. [143] [144] Mark Pauly suggested that a combination of the two approaches would work better than either one alone. [145]
Various analyses of the two candidates' plans came to widely varying predictions of their costs and effects. A comparison by The Tax Policy Center, a project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute estimated that Obama's proposals could cost $1.6 trillion over 10 years, while the tax-related provisions of McCain's proposals could cost $1.3 trillion over the same period. A comparison by The Lewin Group, a subsidiary of UnitedHealth Group , published in October 2008, found that the McCain plan would reduce the number of uninsured by 21.1 million and cost $2.05 trillion over 10 years, while the Obama plan would reduce the uninsured by 26.6 million and increase federal spending by $1.17 trillion over the same period. [146] Estimates prepared by HSI Networks found that the McCain plan would reduce the uninsured by 27.5 million at an annual cost of $287 billion, [147] and the Obama plan would reduce the uninsured by 25.5 million at an annual cost of $452 billion. [148]
A poll released in early November 2008, found that voters supporting Obama listed health care as their second priority; voters supporting McCain listed it as fourth, tied with the war in Iraq. Affordability was the primary health care priority among both sets of voters. Obama voters were more likely than McCain voters to believe government can do much about health care costs. [149]
In an October 17–20, 2008, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll of registered voters, 2% said race made them more likely to vote for Barack Obama, 4% said it made them less likely to do so, and 2% were not sure. The other 92% of respondents said race was not a major factor in their vote. (margin of error was ±2.9%). [150]
A July 18–21, 2008, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed that 20% of African American registered voters and 8% of white registered voters considered race the single most important factor when voting (margin of error was ±3.1%). This percentage increased in both groups from previous polls. [151]
A June 6–9, 2008, NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll showed that 17% were enthusiastic about Obama being the first African American president, 70% were comfortable or indifferent, and 13% had reservations or were uncomfortable (margin of error was ±3.1%). [152]
Obama generally avoided racial issues in his campaign. He would often place white people behind him when in a hall speaking to a large black group in order to avoid racial imagery. [153] On June 11, 2008, Fox News Channel used the phrase "Outraged liberals: Stop picking on Obama's baby mama " in an on screen graphic in a discussion as to whether U.S. presidential candidate Barack Obama 's wife, Michelle , was being unfairly criticized. A senior vice president of programming at Fox said in a statement that a producer "exercised poor judgment" during the segment. [154] There were also attempts to interpret a fist tap as either a racial move, or a "terrorist fist jab". [155]
September 26: The first presidential debate took place at the University of Mississippi . The central issues debated were supposed to be foreign policy and national security. However, due to the economic climate, some questions appeared on this topic. The debate was formatted into nine nine-minute segments, and the moderator, Jim Lehrer of PBS , introduced the topics. [157]
October 7: The second presidential debate took place at Belmont University . It was a town meeting format debate moderated by NBC News anchor Tom Brokaw , and addressed issues raised by members of the audience, particularly the economy . [159]
October 15: The third and final presidential debate was hosted at Hofstra University . It focused on domestic and economic policy. Like the first presidential debate, it was formatted into segments, with moderator Bob Schieffer introducing the topics. [159]
Another debate was sponsored by the Columbia University political union and took place there on October 19. All candidates who could theoretically win the 270 electoral votes needed to win the election were invited, and Ralph Nader , Cynthia McKinney , and Chuck Baldwin agreed to attend. Amy Goodman , principal host of Democracy Now! , moderated. It was broadcast on cable by C-SPAN and on the Internet by Break-the-Matrix. [160]
The reported cost of campaigning for president has increased significantly in recent years. One source reported that if the costs for both Democratic and Republican campaigns were added together (for the presidential primary election, general election, and the political conventions), the costs have more than doubled in only eight years ($448.9 million in 1996, $649.5 million in 2000, and $1.01 billion in 2004). [161] In January 2007, Federal Election Commission Chairman Michael E. Toner estimated that the 2008 race would be a $1 billion election, and that to be taken seriously, a candidate would have needed to raise at least $100 million by the end of 2007. [162]
Although he had said he would not be running for president, published reports in 2007 indicated that billionaire and New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg had been considering a presidential bid as an independent with up to $1 billion of his own fortune to finance it. [163] Bloomberg ultimately ended this speculation by unequivocally stating that he would not run. [164]
With the increase in money expenditures, many candidates did not use the public financing system funded by the presidential election campaign fund checkoff . John McCain, [165] Tom Tancredo, [166] John Edwards, [167] Chris Dodd, [168] and Joe Biden [169] qualified for and elected to take public funds throughout the primary process. Major Democratic candidates Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama chose not to participate in the public financing system. [170]
According to required campaign filings as reported by the Federal Election Commission (FEC), 148 candidates for all parties collectively raised $1,644,712,232 and spent $1,601,104,696 for the primary and general campaigns combined through November 24, 2008. The amounts raised and spent by the major candidates, according to the same source, were as follows:

Notable expressions and phrases[ edit ]
That One : McCain's reference to Obama during the 2nd debate.
Lipstick on a pig : Obama used this phrase to insinuate that any changes that McCain was advocating from the policies of George W. Bush would only be slight modifications of Bush's policies but the underlying policies would be the same, and in Obama's opinion, bad. Some Republicans called it sexism, claiming it was a reference to Sarah Palin, who cracked a joke during the Republican convention that the only difference between a hockey mom and a pit bull is lipstick. [172]
Howard Dean collected large contributions through the Internet in his 2004 primary run. In 2008, candidates went even further to reach out to Internet users through their own sites and such sites as YouTube , MySpace , and Facebook . [173] [174]
On December 16, 2007, Ron Paul collected $6 million , more money on a single day through Internet donations than any presidential candidate in US history. [175] [176] [177]
Not only did the Internet allow candidates to raise money, but also it gave them a tool to appeal to newer and younger demographics. Political pundits were now evaluating candidates based on their social media following. Senator Barack Obama's victory is credited to his competitive edge in social media and Internet following. Obama had over 2 million American supporters on Facebook and 100,000 followers on Twitter , while McCain attracted only 600,000 Facebook supporters (likes) and 4,600 followers on Twitter. Obama's YouTube channel held 115,000 subscribers and more than 97 million video views. Obama had maintained a similar advantage over Senator Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Primary. [178]
Obama's edge in social media was crucial to the election outcome. According to a study by the Pew Internet and American Life project, 35 percent of Americans relied on online video for election news. Ten percent of Americans used social networking sites to learn about the election. [179] The 2008 election showed huge increases in Internet use.
Another study done after the election gave a lot of insight on young voters. Thirty-seven percent of Americans ages 18–24 got election news from social networking sites. Almost a quarter of Americans saw something about the election in an online video. [180] YouTube and other online video outlets allowed candidates to advertise in ways like never before.
Social media allowed voters to share their voting experience. On November 5, 2008 at 10:30 p.m., 4.9 million Facebook users had already posted an announcement that they had voted, simply by checking a box on the site. Various websites allowed voters to share concerns over voting malfunctions, ballot shortages and other problems. Social media and the Internet provided a new and interactive voting experience. [181]
Democratic Party candidate Barack Obama created a broad popular movement and a new method of campaigning by courting and mobilizing activists, donations, and voters through the Internet. It was part of a campaign that mobilized grassroots workers in every state. Obama also set fundraising records in more than one month by gaining support from a record-breaking number of individual small donors. [182]
Anonymous and semi-anonymous smear campaigns , traditionally done with fliers and push calling , also spread to the Internet. [183] Organizations specializing in the production and distribution of viral material, such as Brave New Films , emerged; such organizations have been said to be having a growing influence on American politics. [184]
YouTube was considered to be a valuable asset for free advertising. Joe Trippi, the manager of Howard Dean's presidential campaign, claimed that Obama's YouTube campaign material was watched for 14.5 million hours, a viewing that would have cost $47 million for broadcast television. [180] YouTube and other online video outlets allowed candidates to advertise in ways like never before.
The percentage of Americans who regularly rely on the Internet for campaign news almost doubled (13 to 24 percent) from 2004 to 2008, according to a 2008 study from the Pew Research Center. The percentage of Americans who relied on traditional news sources was either stagnant or declining. [185]
A 2011 study by Ad Age magazine shows that 39 percent of voting-age social media users repost and share political messages. The study also recorded 1/3 of Facebook friends opening video or article links. The 2008 election was a catalyst for Internet use in American politics. Jay Samit, a writer at Ad Age magazine, predicted the 2012 election to be "the most participatory election in our nation's history" because of social media. [186]
Some pre-election controversies in the election revolved around challenges to voter registration lists, involving techniques such as caging lists alleged to constitute voter suppression .
Allegations of voter list purges using unlawful criteria caused controversy in at least six swing states : Colorado , Indiana , Ohio , Michigan , Nevada and North Carolina . [187] On October 5, 2008 the Republican Lt. Governor of Montana, John Bohlinger , accused the Montana Republican Party of vote caging to purge 6,000 voters from three counties which trend Democratic. [188] Allegations arose in Michigan that the Republican Party planned to challenge the eligibility of voters based on lists of foreclosed homes. [189] The campaign of Democratic presidential nominee Barack Obama filed a lawsuit challenging this. The House Judiciary Committee wrote to the Department of Justice requesting an investigation. [190]
Virginia election authorities were ordered by a federal judge to preserve late-arriving absentee ballots sent by active-duty military personnel following a suit by the McCain campaign. It alleged that the state sent absentee ballots late to service members. [191] According to federal law, absentee ballots must be mailed to troops in foreign countries at least 45 days before an election. The charge against Virginia was that the ballots were not printed until after the deadline and therefore were mailed late to soldiers abroad. [192]
Guam 's 173,000 residents are U.S. citizens, and must obey U.S. laws passed in Washington, yet they have neither a voting member of Congress, nor votes in the Electoral College. [193] Since 1980, they have held a straw poll for president at the same time as the U.S. national elections. In 2007, Guam's legislature voted to move the straw poll up to September to draw attention to the choices of Guam's population and their continued disfranchisement, [193] but the governor vetoed the bill. [194] Obama won the 2008 Guam straw poll with 20,120 votes to McCain's 11,940. [195]
Libertarian candidate Bob Barr filed a lawsuit in Texas to have Obama and McCain removed from the ballot in that state. [196] His campaign alleged that both the candidates had missed the August 26 deadline to file, and were present on the ballot contrary to Texas election law. Neither candidate at the time of the deadline had been confirmed as the candidate for their respective parties. The Texas Supreme Court dismissed the lawsuit without explanation. [197]
In Ohio , identified by both parties as a key state, allegations surfaced from both Republicans and Democrats that individuals from out of state were moving to the state temporarily and attempting to vote despite not meeting the state's requirement of permanent residency for more than 29 days. The Franklin County Board of Elections referred 55 cases of possible voting irregularities to the local prosecutor. [198] Three groups attracted particular notice: 'Vote from Home,' 'Vote Today Ohio,' and 'Drop Everything and Come to Ohio.' Vote from Home attracted the most attention when thirteen of the group's members moved to the same location in eastern Columbus. Members of the group organized by Marc Gustafson, including several Marshall and Rhodes scholars studying at Oxford University , settled with Franklin County Prosecutor Ron O'Brien to have their challenged ballots withdrawn. [199] [200] [201] [202] The Obama campaign and others alleged that members of the McCain campaign had also voted without properly establishing residency. [198] Since 1953, only six people in Ohio have gone to prison for illegal voting. [203]
Republicans leveled significant criticism at media outlets' coverage of the presidential election season. An October 22, 2008 Pew Research Center poll estimated 70% of registered voters believed journalists wanted Barack Obama to win the election, as opposed to 9% for John McCain. [204] Another Pew survey, conducted after the election, found that 67% of voters thought that the press fairly covered Obama, versus 30% who viewed the coverage as unfair. Regarding McCain, 53% of voters viewed his press coverage as fair versus 44% who characterized it as unfair. Among affiliated Democrats, 83% believed the press fairly covered Obama; just 22% of Republicans thought the press was fair to McCain. [205]
At the February debate, Tim Russert of NBC News was criticized for what some perceived as disproportionately tough questioning of Democratic presidential contender Hillary Clinton . [206] Among the questions, Russert had asked Clinton, but not Obama, to provide the name of the new Russian President ( Dmitry Medvedev ). [206] This was later parodied on Saturday Night Live . In October 2007, liberal commentators accused Russert of harassing Clinton over the issue of supporting drivers' licenses for illegal immigrants . [207]
On April 16, ABC News hosted a debate in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania . Moderators Charles Gibson and George Stephanopoulos were criticized by viewers, bloggers and media critics for the poor quality of their questions. [206] [207] Many viewers said they considered some of the questions irrelevant when measured against the importance of the faltering economy or the Iraq war . Included in that category were continued questions about Obama's former pastor, Senator Hillary Clinton's assertion that she had to duck sniper fire in Bosnia more than a decade ago, and Senator Obama's not wearing an American flag pin. [206] The moderators focused on campaign gaffes and some believed they focused too much on Obama. [207] Stephanopoulos defended their performance, saying "Senator Obama was the front-runner" and the questions were "not inappropriate or irrelevant at all." [206] [207]
In an op-ed published on 2008 April 27 in The New York Times , Elizabeth Edwards wrote that the media covered much more of "the rancor of the campaign" and "amount of money spent" than "the candidates' priorities, policies and principles." [208] Author Erica Jong commented that "our press has become a sea of triviality, meanness and irrelevant chatter." [209] A Gallup poll released on May 29, 2008 also estimated that more Americans felt the media was being harder on Hillary Clinton than they were towards Barack Obama. [210]
The Project for Excellence in Journalism and Harvard University's Joan Shorenstein Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy conducted a study of 5,374 media narratives and assertions about the presidential candidates from January 1 through March 9, 2008. The study found that Obama received 69% favorable coverage and Clinton received 67%, compared to only 43% favorable media coverage of McCain. [211] Another study by the Center for Media and Public Affairs at George Mason University found the media coverage of Obama to be 72% negative from June 8 to July 21 compared to 57% negative for McCain. [212] An October 29 study found 29% of stories about Obama to be negative, compared to 57% of stories about McCain being negative. [213]

Election Day was on November 4, 2008. The majority of states allowed early voting, with all states allowing some form of absentee voting. [214] Voters cast votes for listed presidential candidates but were actually selecting representatives for their state's Electoral College slate.
A McCain victory quickly became improbable as Obama amassed early wins in his home state of Illinois , the Northeast , and the critical battleground states of Ohio (which no Republican has ever been elected President without winning) and Pennsylvania by 9:30 PM Eastern Standard Time. [215] Obama won the entire Northeast by comfortable margins and the Great Lakes states of Michigan , Wisconsin , and Minnesota by double digits. McCain held on to traditionally Republican states like North Dakota , South Dakota , Nebraska , Kansas , Oklahoma , Montana , Utah , Idaho , Wyoming , and his home state of Arizona . McCain, unlike Bush in 2000 and 2004, failed to win all the southern states: Obama won Florida , North Carolina , and Virginia . Obama also won the hotly contested states of Iowa and New Mexico , which Al Gore had won in 2000 and George W. Bush in 2004. Also, for only the second time since 1940 ( 1964 being the other), Indiana went Democratic, giving Obama all eight Great Lakes states, the first time a presidential candidate had won all of them since Richard Nixon in 1972 .
CNN and Fox News called Virginia for Obama shortly before 11:00 PM, leaving him only 50 electoral votes shy of victory with only six West Coast states ( California , Oregon , Washington , Idaho , Alaska , and Hawaii ) still voting. All American networks called the election in favor of Obama at 11:00 PM as the polls closed on the West Coast. Obama was immediately declared the winner in California, Oregon, Washington, and Hawaii, McCain won Idaho, and the Electoral College totals were updated to 297 for Obama and 146 for McCain (270 are needed to win). McCain gave a concession speech half an hour later in his hometown of Phoenix, Arizona . [216] Obama appeared just before midnight Eastern Time in Grant Park , Chicago , in front of a crowd of 250,000 people to deliver his victory speech . [217]
Cartogram of the Electoral Votes for 2008 United States presidential election, each square representing one electoral vote. The map shows the impact of winning swing states . Nebraska, being one of two states that are not winner-take-all, for the first time had its votes split, with its second congressional district voting for Obama.
The voter turnout for this election was broadly predicted to be high by American standards, [221] [222] and a record number of votes were cast. [223] The final tally of total votes counted was 131.3 million, compared to 122.3 million in 2004 (which also boasted the highest record since 1968 , the last presidential election before the voting age was lowered to 18). Expressed as a percentage of eligible voters, 131.2 million votes could reflect a turnout as high as 63.0% of eligible voters, which would be the highest since 1960 . [224] [225] This 63.0% turnout rate is based on an estimated eligible voter population of 208,323,000. [225] Another estimate puts the eligible voter population at 213,313,508, resulting in a turnout rate of 61.6%, which would be the highest turnout rate since 1968. [226]
American University 's Center for the Study of the American Electorate released a report on November 6, 2008, two days after the election, which concluded that the anticipated increase in turnout had failed to materialize. [224] That report was the basis for some news articles that indicated voter turnout failed to meet expectations. [227] [228] When the remaining votes were counted after the release of the report, the total number of votes cast in the presidential election was raised to 131.2 million, which surpassed the American University report's preliminary estimate of 126.5 to 128.5 million voters by a factor of between 2% and 4%.
The election saw increased participation from African Americans , who made up 11.1% of the electorate in 2004, versus 13.0% in 2008. [229] According to exit polls, over 95% of African Americans voted for Obama. This played a critical role in southern states such as North Carolina. 74% of North Carolina's registered African American voters turned out, as opposed to 69% of North Carolinians in general, with Obama carrying 100% (with rounding) of African-American females and African Americans age 18 to 29, according to exit polling. [230] This was the case in Virginia as well where much higher turnout among African Americans propelled Obama to victory in the former Republican stronghold. [231] Even in southern states where Obama was unsuccessful, such as Georgia and Mississippi, due to large African American turnout he was much more competitive than John Kerry in 2004. [232] [233]

No other candidate had ballot access in enough states to win 270 electoral votes. All six candidates appeared on the ballot for a majority of the voters, while the 17 other listed candidates were available to no more than 30% of the voters. [235]
The following candidates (and/or parties) had ballot listing and/or write-in status in more than one state: [236]
Alan Keyes ( America's Independent Party ) received 47,746 votes; listed in three states: Colorado and Florida, plus California (listed as American Independent), and also had write-in status in Kentucky, Ohio, Texas, and Utah.
Ron Paul received 42,426 votes; listed in Louisiana (Louisiana Taxpayers) and in Montana (Constitution), with write-in status in California.
Gloria La Riva ( Party for Socialism and Liberation ) received 6,808 votes [237] nationally; listed in 12 states: Arkansas, Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Utah, Vermont, Washington, and Wisconsin.
Brian Moore ( Socialist Party , see Brian Moore presidential campaign, 2008 ) received 6,538 votes; listed in eight states: Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Jersey, Ohio, and Wisconsin, and Tennessee (independent) and Vermont (Liberty Union). He also filed for write-in status in 17 other states: Alaska, Connecticut, Illinois, Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wyoming.
Róger Calero ( Socialist Workers Party ) received 5,151 votes; listed in ten states. He was listed by name in Delaware, Minnesota, New Jersey, New York, and Vermont. James Harris was listed as his stand-in in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, and Washington, and also had write-in status in California.

Tom Stevens ( Objectivist ) received 755 votes; listed in Colorado and Florida.
Gene Amondson ( Prohibition ) received 653 votes; listed in Colorado, Florida, and Louisiana.
Jonathan Allen ( HeartQuake ) received 483 votes; listed only in Colorado, with write-in status in Arizona, Georgia, Montana, Texas, and other states.
The following candidates (parties) were listed on the ballot in only one state:
Richard Duncan (Independent) – Ohio; 3,905 votes.
John Joseph Polachek ( New Party ) Illinois; 1,149 votes.
George Phillies – New Hampshire (also listed with the label Libertarian); 531 votes.
In Nevada, 6,267 votes were cast for "None Of These Candidates". [238] In the three states that officially keep track of "blank" votes for President, 103,193 votes were recorded as "blank". [239] More than 100,000 write-in votes were cast and recorded for a scattering of other candidates, including 62 votes for " Santa Claus " (in ten states) and 11 votes for " Mickey Mouse " (in five states). [240]
According to the Federal Election Commission, an unusually high number of "miscellaneous" write-ins were cast for president in 2008, including 112,597 tallied in the 17 states that record votes for non-listed candidates. [241] There were more presidential candidates on the ballot than at any other time in U. S. history, except for the 1992 election , which also had 23 candidates listed in at least one state.
Popular vote totals are from the official Federal Election Commission report . The results of the electoral vote were certified by Congress on January 8, 2009. [220]

Obama, having a Caucasian mother and Kenyan father of the Luo ethnic group , [248] became the first African American as well as the first bi-racial president. [249] The Obama-Biden ticket was also the first winning ticket in American history on which neither candidate was a White Anglo-Saxon Protestant ; Biden is Roman Catholic and is the first Roman Catholic to be elected Vice President. [250] Obama and Biden were the first President and Vice President elected from the Senate since 1960 ( John F. Kennedy / Lyndon B. Johnson ), Obama became the first Northern Democratic president since Kennedy, and the Obama-Biden ticket was the first winning Democratic ticket to feature two Northerners since 1940 ( Franklin D. Roosevelt / Henry A. Wallace ). Also, Obama became the first Democratic candidate to win a majority of the popular vote since Jimmy Carter in 1976 , the first to win a majority of both votes and states since Lyndon Johnson in 1964 , and the first Northern Democrat to win a majority of both votes and states since Franklin Roosevelt in 1944 .
Swing by state. States are listed by (increasing) percentage of Democratic votes, showing how the share of the vote changed between 2004 and 2008. Only five states trended more Republican: Arkansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Tennessee and West Virginia.
Prior to the election, commentators discussed whether Senator Obama would be able to redraw the electoral map by winning states that had been voting for Republican candidates in recent decades. [251] In many ways, he was successful. He won every region of the country by double digits except the South, which John McCain won by nine percent. Obama won Delaware , the District of Columbia , Maryland , North Carolina , Florida , and Virginia in the South (region as defined by the US Census Bureau ). McCain won most of the Deep South, where white voters have supported Republican candidates by large margins in the last few decades. [252] Obama also defied political bellwethers, becoming the first person to win the presidency while losing Missouri since 1956 (as well as the first Democrat ever to do so) and while losing Kentucky and Tennessee since 1960 . He was the first Democrat to win the presidency without winning West Virginia since 1916 and the first Democrat to win without Arkansas since that state joined the Union in 1836. Indiana and Virginia voted for the Democratic nominee for the first time since 1964 . Although Obama did not win other normally Republican states such as Georgia and Montana (which were won by Bill Clinton in 1992 ), he nonetheless was competitive in both. He lost Montana by just under 3% and Georgia by slightly more than 5%. Also notably, Barack Obama won all of the 2004 swing states (states that either Kerry or Bush won by less than 5%) by a margin of 8.5 percent or more except for Ohio, which the Democrat carried by 4.5 percent.
Obama was the first presidential candidate to split the electoral votes from Nebraska . Together with Maine , which has not yet split its electoral votes, Nebraska is one of two states that split their electoral votes, two going to the statewide popular vote winner and the rest going to the winner of each respective congressional district (Nebraska has three, and Maine has two). Obama won the electoral vote from Nebraska's 2nd congressional district , which contains the city of Omaha . Nebraska's other four electoral votes went to John McCain.
This election exhibited the continuation of some of the polarization trends evident in the 2000 and 2004 elections. [253] McCain won whites 55-43 percent, while Obama won blacks 95-4 percent, [254] Hispanics 67-31 percent, and Asians 62-35 percent. Voters aged 18–29 voted for Obama by 66–32 percent while elderly voters backed McCain 53–45 percent. [255] The 25-year age gap between McCain and Obama was the widest in U.S. presidential election history among the top two candidates. [256]
The 2008 presidential election featured the rise of data journalism in the coverage of politics. Nate Silver , of FiveThiryEight.com, correctly predicted the outcome of 49 of the 50 states and all 35 Senate races. [257]

Scientists uncover the fossil of a new species of flying dinosaur in northeastern China thought to have existed 120 million years ago. It is the first dinosaur ever found with four wings. The Chinese team that found the dinosaur has named it Microraptor gui, after Chinese paleontologist Gu Zhiwei (Jan. 22).
A joint NASA-Princeton University satellite, the Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP), produced a high-resolution map that captured the oldest light in the universe. It provides some of the most important cosmological discoveries in years. The age of the universe has now been accurately determined as 13.7 billion years old and the birth of stars has been pinpointed to just 200 million years after the Big Bang. The WMAP image also revealed the contents of the universe: only 4% is made up of atoms, or the physical universe as we know it. The remainder is made up of poorly understood substances: dark energy (73%) and dark matter (23%). These findings are consistent with the Big Bang and inflation theories, which assert that the universe materialized in a “big bang” and immediately began cooling and expanding (Feb. 11) .
Three fossilized skulls discovered near the Ethiopian village of Herto in 1997 have now been identified as the oldest known remains of modern humans. Assigned to a new human subspecies called Homo sapiens idaltu (idaltu means elder in the Afar language of Ethiopia), the skulls are estimated to be about 160,000 years olda good 50,000 years older than any previously discovered Homo sapiens (announcement made: June 11).
Scientists publish the first comprehensive analysis of the genetic code of the Y chromosome. The Y chromosome provides just 78 genes out of the estimated 30,000 in human DNA and makes few important contributions beyond determining gender (females have two X chromosomes; males have an X and a Y chromosome). Once the size of the X chromosome, which contains about 1,000 genes, the Y chromosome has been rapidly decaying over the course of human evolution, dwindling to a mere tenth of its former self (June 19).
The Hubble telescope has detected the oldest known planetand it appears to have been formed billions of years earlier than astronomers thought possible. Nicknamed Methuselah after the aged biblical patriarch, the planet is an astonishing 12.7 billion years old (July 10).

The unexploded bomb in room 1808 of the JW Marriott hotel was programmed to go off prior to the other bomb there, but its timer malfunctioned.

Police believe planning for the bombings was led by Noordin M. Top . The first meeting had been held on April 30. Ibrohim, a florist who worked for a florist company which had stores in both the bombed hotels, was another key organiser. Ibrohim was recruited in 2000 by Saifudin Jaelani (aka Saifudin Zuhri bin Jaelani Irsyad), his brother-in-law, while he was working as a florist at the Hotel Mulia in Jakarta. In 2005, Ibrohim and Jaelani were inaugurated as members of Noordin's special forces. Ibrohim set strategies, conducted surveys of the locations and smuggled the bombs into the hotels. Saifudin Jaelani is believed to have also recruited the suicide bombers for the operation.
The bombs were smuggled into the JW Marriott one day before the blast through the hotel's loading dock using a pick-up truck rented by Ibrohim. The bomb design and materials of an unexploded bomb found by Police in room 1808 were identical to those used by Jemaah Islamiyah in previous attacks. [27]
The suicide bomber of the JW Marriott Hotel was Dani Dwi Permana, an 18-year-old graduate of a private senior high school in Bogor , West Java . The suicide bomber of the Ritz-Carlton hotel was Nana Ikhwan Maulana, a 28-year-old former resident of Pandeglang , Banten . Dani rented room 1808 in the JW Marriott. The room was paid for by Amir Abdillah, who was arrested on August 5.
On August 7, police raided a house in Temanggung , Central Java . Three people were arrested and one person was killed, later identified to be Ibrohim. On August 8, police raided a house in Bekasi , West Java , killing two people believed to be preparing to attack the Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono with a truck bomb near his private residence in Bogor , West Java .
Funding for the bombings is believed to have been provided from the Middle East. A number of suspects, including a Saudi Arabian national, have been arrested by Indonesian police for their involvement in handling the funds.
The bombings were deplored by numerous governments—in Indonesia, elsewhere in the region, and around the world. [2] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] President Barack Obama, who spent a portion of his childhood in Jakarta stated, "I strongly condemn the attacks that occurred this morning in Jakarta, and extend my deepest condolences to all of the victims and their loved ones.

Manchester United , which had been scheduled to play an exhibition football match in Jakarta on 20 July 2009 and had booked rooms at the Ritz Carlton, cancelled the Jakarta leg of its tour. [5] [14]
The hotel was closed for 2 weeks and reopened to the public on Monday, 3 August 2009 at 10:00 WIB . The 17th United States Ambassador to Indonesia 's Cameron R.

Background
Since the 2002 Bali bombings , in which over 200 were killed, Indonesia has stepped up attempts to crack down on terrorism. An anti-terrorism law was confirmed by the Indonesian legislature in 2003. [11] The 2002 attack was carried out by Jemaah Islamiyah , an al-Qaeda -linked group seeking to unite Indonesia, Malaysia , and the southern Philippines under an Islamic state. [12] [13]
The attacks
The Marriott bombing occurred first and was followed five minutes later by the Ritz bombing. [5] Police moved to seal off the surrounding area. [5] At noon local time, an unexploded bomb was found in room 1808 of the Marriott, together with "bomb-making equipment". [15] [16] [17]
The Ritz-Carlton explosion is thought to have originated in the Airlangga Restaurant on the second story, [5] [6] where people were eating breakfast. [2] There was said to be glass everywhere. [5] A part of the facade of the Ritz Carlton was blown away by the blast and windows had been blown out.
The Marriott bombing occurred during one of a series of periodic breakfast meetings of CEOs and other prominent (and predominantly expatriate) members of the Jakarta business community hosted by James Castle, president of AmCham Indonesia, a branch of the United States Chamber of Commerce in Jakarta. [4] [18] The Marriott bomb was detonated in a small breakfast room rented for the event, and not in the main restaurant.

Two weeks prior to the bombing, there was a tip call to senior Indonesian police officers from a militant captured during a raid in Semarang that two carloads of bomb-making materials were heading to the capital, Jakarta . During the raid, the police also discovered some drawings outlining specific areas in the city for possible attacks. [2]
A Toyota Kijang , bought on 20 July 2003, from a Jakarta businessman for 25.75 million rupiah [3] was loaded with explosives and driven through the taxi stand in front of the Marriott Hotel. The vehicle stopped briefly in front of the lobby and CCTV cameras show a security guard approaching the vehicle, briefly speaking to the driver. The security guard then turns and a detonation can be seen. It is still not clear if the explosion was accidental, set off by remote detonation or a timer exploding prematurely. If the vehicle had kept a course heading straight for the lobby the damage would undoubtedly have been more severe. The blast radius was visible along the shattered windows of nearby buildings. According to Indonesian police, one of the ingredients in the car bomb contained the same chemical [4] used in the deadly 2002 Bali bombings . [5] The bombs in both cases were made of the same mixture of explosives, mobile phones were used as detonators, and the attackers had tried to scrape off the identification numbers from the vehicle bombs. [3]
The severed head of Asmar Latin Sani , aged 28, and from West Sumatra , was later found on the fifth floor of the building, [6] The head was identified by two jailed members of the Jemaah Islamiyah group who said they had recruited him. [4]
Investigators uncovered the charred remains of a battery used to power the bomb and said it was similar to the ones used in a series of bombings against Christian churches on Christmas Eve 2000, in which 19 people were killed. [3]
The attack came two days before a verdict in the trial of the Bali nightclub bombers. Al-Qaeda claimed responsibility for the attack and the perpetrators are known to have trained in al Qaeda training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan . [7]
“
”
Jemaah Islamiyah (JI), an organisation affiliated with al-Qaeda , is alleged to have carried out the bombing. The al-Qaeda link has been backed by Indonesia's Minister of Defense , Matori Abdul Djalil who said the Marriott bombers had trained with al-Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan . "Each one of them has special abilities received from training in Afghanistan and Pakistan," Matori Abdul Djalil said on 11 August 2003. He also claimed that the bombers were linked to a group of people arrested in the eastern Indonesian town of Semarang during July 2004 and are alleged to be members of Jemaah Islamiah.
"There are many more Jemaah Islamiah members on the loose in Indonesia ... Because of this I am sure that JI is behind all of this,"
On 5 May 2006 the International Crisis Group released its Asia Report No 114 entitled Terrorism in Indonesia. It described the events leading up the attack;
The trigger for the Marriott bombing came in December 2002, when Indonesian police stepped up the hunt for Jemaah Islamiyah members while investigating the 2002 Bali bombings . Toni Togar , a JI member based in Medan , North Sumatra , was nervous, because his house stored all the explosives left over from JI's 2000 Christmas Eve bombings . He contacted Noordin Mohammad Top to tell him he was going to throw them out. Noordin previously was part of the team that carried out the Christmas Eve bombings which was led by Hambali and included Imam Samudra and many of the other 2002 Bali bombers. He told Togar to hold on as he "saw good materials being wasted".
Abu Bakar Bashir approved of Hambali's activities, and Toni Togar was selected to take part in the new bombing plot. Hambali had already set a precedent for a secret team pursuing jihad on its own. This was in part because he controlled the separate funding from al-Qaeda . In January 2003, Muhammad Rais , Noordin and Azahari Husin moved to Bengkulu , where a group of JI members lived, including Asmar Latin Sani , who became the Marriott suicide bomber. The next stages of the operation took place in February 2003 when the explosives were transported from Dumai to Bengkulu via Pekanbaru ,
Azahari secured the detonators with a new team member, Masrizal bin Ali Umar . also known as Tohir, another Pondok Ngruki graduate and a Luqmanul Hakiem teacher who was a close friend of Rais. After the explosives safely reached Bengkulu as unaccompanied baggage on an intercity bus, they were stored at the house of Sardona Siliwangi , another Ngruki student and JI member. At the time, Sardona, who was working with Asmar Latin Sani, opened a bank account in March 2003 to facilitate financial transactions for Noordin.
In late April 2003, Mohamed Ihsan also known as Gembrot and Idris , who was involved in the 2000 Christmas Eve bombings transported the explosives again. In May, he and Toni Togar, robbed a bank in Medan on 6 May to raise funds for the project. "Ismail", a Luqmanul Hakiem student who had previously worked with Rais and Noordin in the shock absorber repair shop in Bukittinggi , then received an email from Noordin asking him to pick up some packages from a man in Dumai . Ismail obliged, and the package turned out to be cash in Australian dollars , sent by Hambali via a courier.
A book that appears based in part on transcripts of Hambali's interrogation says Hambali arranged for A$25,000 to be sent: A$15,000 for operational expenses, A$10,000 for Bali bomber families. Conboy, op. cit., p. 229. Hambali's younger brother, Rusman Gunawan , who was arrested in Karachi in September 2003, testified Hambali had secured a promise of A$50,000 from an Noordin on how to bring the cash from Dumai to Lampung .
On 4 June 2003, in Lampung, the final team was put together: Noordin, Azhari, Ismail, Asmar Latin Sani, and Tohir. Noordin assigned the tasks and explained that he was in charge, Azhari was field commander and Ismail his assistant. Asmar and Tohir would be in charge of renting the house, buying the vehicles and getting the explosives to Jakarta . Asmar had agreed to be the suicide bomber . When they got to Jakarta, they split into two teams to survey four possible targets. Azhari and Ismail examined the Marriott and a Citibank branch; Noordin and Tohir looked at the Jakarta International School and the Australian International School . Eventually they decided on the hotel because of the American brand name and the fact that it was easy to reach. The bombing took place on 5 August.
They all drove back to Blitar with 25 kilograms of potassium chlorate and ten kilos of sulfur for bomb making, as well as a pistol and ammunition. Not long afterwards, another operative delivered 30 extra kilograms of TNT .
Around this time a pamphlet was circulating in jihadist groups that was a translation from Arabic into Indonesian of an article that first appeared in the al-Qaeda on-line magazine Sawt al-Jihad . Entitled "You Don't Need to Go to Iraq for Jihad", it was written in 2003 by a Saudi jihadist, Muhammad bin Ahmad as-Salim . [8]
Hambali : Riduan Isamuddin, is being held at Guantanamo Bay detention camp , since his August 2002 arrest in Thailand . He is accused of masterminding the 2002 Bali bombings as well as the Marriott blast. According to interrogation reports, Hambali was undergoing plans to develop biological weapons , in particular anthrax . Hambali was al Qaeda's main connection in South East Asia, and was apparently trying to open an "Al Qaeda bio-weapons branch plant" in either Malaysia or Indonesia. He told investigators he had been "working on an Al Qaeda Anthrax program in Kandahar," Afghanistan . [9]
Dr. Azahari Husin , a former university lecturer, was also known as the "Demolition Man" because of his bomb-making skils, and used a mobile phone to detonate the Marriott bomb and included ingredients similar to other Indonesian blasts. According to Indonesian police, "If Azahari did not make the bomb, then its creator was following his manual." [10]
Noordin Mohammed Top was suspected of helping finance the Bali blast and helping build the Marriott bomb. [11] Noordin is a Malaysian citizen. [12]
Muhammad Rais was convicted in May 2004 of violating anti-terrorism laws in connection with the attack. Rais transported the explosives from various towns to Jakarta , where they were used in the bomb. He was sentenced to seven years in prison for his role. [7] ""We saw the Marriott attack as a message from Osama bin Laden,"" Rais said at his trail. [13]
Rusman Gunawan alias "Gun Gun" was sentenced in October 2004 to four years jail for facilitating and aiding terrorism. In particular he was found to have transferred the money (in Australian dollars ) that was ultimately used to finance the Marriott bombing. He and six other Indonesian students were arrested during raids in Pakistan. He trained at the Al Ghuraba training camp in Afghanistan. [14] In 2002 while he attended university in Pakistan, he took over as the "intermediary" for e-mail messages between al-Qaeda and Hambali, who at the time was hiding in Cambodia . [15]
Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep is one of Hambali's key lieutenants. and like Hambali is being held at the Guantanamo Bay detention camp . He allegedly transferred the al Qaeda funds used for the bombing and knew of Jemaah Islamiah plots to launch attacks elsewhere in South East Asia. The CIA claims he was to be a suicide bomber for a "second wave" of al Qaeda attacks targeting Los Angeles. [16]
Gempur Angkoro , alias Jabir, is al-Ghozi's cousin and was one of Top's most trusted men; he, was killed in a raid on 29 April. Jabir personally assembled the Marriott bomb, and the bombs used in the 2004 Jakarta embassy bombing . (Jakarta Post, 2 May) [17]
Sardona Siliwangi , was the first person to be sentenced for the Marriott attack. He had been "legally and convincingly" proven guilty of an act of terrorism, during his trial in the town of Bengkulu on the island of Sumatra , and sentenced to ten years in prison. Siliwangi had stored at his Bengkulu home, six cartons of explosives left by the suicide operative Asmar Latin Sani . The explosives were later moved to the South Sumatra town of Lubuk Linggau before being taken to Jakarta on the island of Java . [18]
Air Setyawan , Luthfi Haidaroh and Urwahr were all arrested in the Central Java city of Surakarta on 26 July 2004 by Indonesia's Detachment 88 anti-terrorist squad, which is trained and equipped by the United States and Australia. [19]
Stuart A. Levey , the Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence in the United States, believes that the 2002 Bali bombing, and the Marriott Hotel bombing were financed by smuggling $30,000 in cash for each attack from al-Qaeda to allied terrorists in Asia. By contrast, the 9/11 Commission estimated the 11 September 2001 attacks cost between $400,000 and $500,000 over two years—at least some of which was deposited in foreign accounts and accessed by the plotters in the USA. [20]
The Vice President of the United States Dick Cheney said: [21]
Hambali went to the training camps in Afghanistan that they ran back in the '90s, subsequently received funding from al Qaeda, went back then to Indonesia, and was behind some of the major attacks there. So you've got this sort of home-grown, but nonetheless affiliated, extremist operation going now in Indonesia. You'll find the same thing if you go to Morocco, where they had the attack in Casablanca; in Turkey, Istanbul, and so forth.
It was the simultaneous presence at al-Qaeda camps in Afghanistan by militants from across South East Asia that facilitated many of the personal relationships that exist between JI and members of other violent Islamist groups. These include the Moro Islamic Liberation Front , a secessionist movement fighting for a Muslim homeland in the southern Philippines , as well as several other Indonesian, Malaysian and Thai groups. The weight of evidence suggests that although some JI personnel might be inspired by the larger global mystique of figures such as Osama bin Laden, the South East Asian group remains operationally and organisationally distinct. [22]
The main Jakarta stock-market index tumbled 3.1 percent after the attack and its currency, the rupiah , lost as much as 2 percent of its value against the US dollar. [23]
Australia issued a warning for its citizens to avoid all international hotels in Jakarta after intelligence found the capital could be under the threat of further attacks. [1]

J.W. Marriott and Ritz-Carlton properties are site of two explosions. Eight people confirmed dead.
INTERNATIONAL REPORT—Early this morning local time the JW Marriott Hotel and The Ritz-Carlton Jakarta Hotel, both located in Mega Kuningan, South Jakarta, Indonesia, were the sites of two separate explosions resulting in at least nine deaths, according to reports.
Marriott International confirmed the bombings around midnight Eastern time yesterday via Twitter: “At approximately 7:48 a.m. local time, explosions occurred at the J.W. Marriott and Ritz-Carlton Hotels in Jakarta, Indonesia.”
The Ritz-Carlton Jakarta was the site of a terrorist bombing that left at least nine dead and others injured.
A report from The Wall Street Journal indicates that suicide bombers are suspected in the events that killed nine and injured at least 53 people.
The JW Marriott explosion is believed to have occurred in the basement car park, according to police in a BBC story . The Ritz-Carlton bomb went off in a third-floor restaurant. And a third, undetonated bomb in the JW Marriott was found in a 18th-floor guestroom thought to be the bombers' headquarters.
The GM of the Ritz-Carlton Kuala Lumpur in neighboring Malaysia told HotelNewsNow.com that for now he didn’t know any more than what media is reporting.
“I haven't spoken to the (Ritz-Carlton Hotel team) in Jakarta recently so all the information I have got (is) from CNN as they have good coverage and have people on the ground in Indonesia,” said Stephen A. Pcokkinias.
“This is a regrettable incident. ... I don’t want to call (the team in Jakarta) as they must be quite busy, but I did text the hotel GM.”
Pierre-Alain Perusset is the managing director of The Ritz-Carlton Jakarta Hotel . Nagesh Chawla is the hotel manager at the JW Marriott Hotel .
It’s business as usual, Pcokkinias said. “We have no incidents in Malaysia so we are not taking any (precautionary) measures.”
From the JW Marriott Kuala Lumpur: “We have not heard anything from the hotel in Jakarta, but we are keeping ourselves updated with the most recent news through the various reports on Internet and television,” said Mahmoud Skaf, hotel manager. “… We have not had any people calling regarding the incident in Jakarta."
ARE YOU THERE?
If you are a hotelier in Jakarta and would like to talk about the incidents, please contact Stacey Mieyal Higgins at Stacey@hotelnewsnow.com .
The implications, however, for other hotels in Asia-Pacific are significant. A story from Channel NewsAsia said hotels in Singapore are stepping up security. The country also issued a travel advisory.
In the story, associate professor Kumar Ramakrishna, S Rajaratnam School of International Studies, said: “The attacks in Jakarta this morning basically drive home the point that although those two hotels, the Ritz-Carlton and the Marriott, were relatively well-protected... a militant network that’s really determined and resourceful may succeed.”
Reuters posted a photo gallery of the hotel damage and human impact.
The Bali Hotels Association issued a statement in which it said that there appeared to be no imminent threat for the area, although hotels were put on red alert.
Bali is about 1,245 kilometers (about 776 miles) away from Jakarta in Indonesia.
“BHA members have briefed their staff to remain calm and focus on the comfort and safety of their guests, and to avoid speculation and rumour surrounding the incidents,” according to the statement. “BHA are keeping their members informed of developments.
“Following a briefing by the Chief of Police in Bali this morning, he indicated that there is no credible threat in place at the present time for Bali; however all members of the community and tourism industry must remain alert to ensure the safety of visitors to Bali and the community at large.”
