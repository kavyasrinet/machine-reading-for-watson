question:What are the locations of attacks in Philippines in 2007?
answer:
 This article is about the Philippine province. For other uses, see Sulu (disambiguation) . (August 2014) Flag Seal Map of the Philippines with Sulu highlighted Seat of Government: Sulu ( Tausug : سوگ, Sug; Chavacano : Provincia de Sulu; Filipino : Lalawigan ng Sulu) is an autonomous island province of the Philippines , located in the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). Its capital is Jolo and it occupies the middle group of islands of the Sulu Archipelago , between Basilan and Tawi-Tawi . Contents The peaceful advent of Islam around 1138 through merchants and traders had a distinct influence on Southeast Asia . The coming of Arabs , Persians and other Muslims paved the way for the arrival of religious missionaries, traders, scholars and travelers to Sulu and Mindanao in the 12th century. Painting of Sulu home & coconut plantation A landmark born of the social process was the founding of the Sultanate of Sulu . Year 1380 CE, Karim-ul Makhdum came to Sulu and introduced Islam to the Philippines. Year 1450 CE, a Johore-born Arab adventurer, Sayyid Abubakar Abirin came to Sulu and lived with Rajah Baguinda Ali , eventually marrying his daughter Dayang-dayang Paramisuli and eventually inheriting Rajah Baguinda's polity (which was a principality before) and turning it into a sultanate . Sayyid Abubakar eventually inherited the rule of Rajah Baguinda, established the Sultanate of Sulu and became its first Sultan . To consolidate his rule, Sayyid Abubakar united the local political units under the umbrella of the Sultanate. He brought Sulu, Zamboanga Peninsula , Palawan and Basilan under its aegis. The navigational error that landed Ferdinand Magellan in Limasawa brought awareness of Europe to the Philippines and opened the door to Spanish colonial incursion. The Spaniards introduced Christianity and a political system of church-state dichotomy, which encountered fierce resistance in the devastating Moro wars from 1578 to 1899. After Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States , American forces came to Jolo and ended the 23 years of Spanish military occupation (1876 to 1899). On August 20, Sultan Jamalul Kiram II and Brig. Gen John C. Bates signed the Bates Agreement that continued the gradual emasculation of the Sultanate started by Spain (Treaty of 1878) until March 1915 when the Sultan abdicated his temporal powers in the Carpenter Agreement. The Agreement eliminated opposition to the civilian government of Gov. Clinton Solidum. The Department of Mindanao and Sulu under Gov. Carpenter was created by Philippine Commission Act 2309 (1914) and ended on February 5, 1920 by Act of Philippine Legislature No. 2878. The Bureau of Non-Christian Tribes was organized and briefly headed by Teofisto Guingona, Sr. With the enactment by the US Congress of the Jones Law (Philippine Autonomy Law) in 1916, ultimate Philippine independence was guaranteed and the Filipinization of public administration began. Sulu, however, had an appointed American governor until 1935 and the Governor General in Manila had a say in Sulu affairs. At any rate, the essence of local governance forged by Rajah Baguinda continued to permeate the ethos of Sulu politics despite centuries of colonial presence. History points to a local government in Sulu that antedates other similar systems in the country. Today, Sulu has a locally constituted government and is part of the ARMM . Sulu Province covers an area of 1,600.4 square kilometres (617.9 sq mi). [1] Sulu's main island, Jolo , has an area of 868.5 square kilometres (335.3 sq mi), [3] making it the 16th largest island of the Philippine Archipelago in terms of area. Sulu is a part of the Sulu Archipelago , which stretches from the tip of the Zamboanga Peninsula to the island of Borneo . The main island and also its islets are located between the island-provinces of Basilan to the northeast, and Tawi-Tawi to the southwest. Source: National Statistics Office [2] Although consisting of a mixed community of Muslims , the Tausug dominate the Sulu Archipelago. The Tausug were among the first inhabitants of the Philippines to embrace Islam as a religion and a way of life. They are referred to as 'people of the current', reflective of their close ties to the sea. The province of Sulu is predominantly agricultural with farming and fishing as its main livelihood activities. Its fertile soil and ideal climate can grow a variety of crops such as abaca , coconuts , oranges , and lanzones as well as exotic fruits seldom found elsewhere in the country such as durian and mangosteen . Fishing is the most important industry since the Sulu Sea is one of the richest fishing grounds in the country. The province also have an extensive pearl industry. Pearls are extensively gathered and a pearl farm is established at Marungas Island. The backs of sea turtles are made into beautiful trays and combs. During breaks from fishing, the people build boats and weave mats. Other industries include coffee processing and fruit preservation. The handicrafts of Sulu have both Islamic and Malay influences. Skilled artisans make boats, bladed weapons, bronze and brassware, pis cloth, embroidered textiles, shellcraft , traditional house carvings, and carved wooden grave markers . ^ a b Province of Sulu: Brief Profile (There seems to be major discrepancies among authoritative sources: 343,699 ha (NSCB 2007), 175,460 ha (NSCB 2000), 167,377 ha (NAMRIA)) This page was last modified on 8 February 2015, at 06:54.

Above: Filipino and US Troops during the PMC Balikatan Exercise Below: A member of the Moro Islamic Liberation Front training with a light machine gun. Date Location 18 American soldiers [23] In 1969, political tensions and open hostilities developed between the Government of the Philippines and Moro Muslim rebel groups. [25] The Moro National Liberation Front ( MNLF ) was established by University of the Philippines professor Nur Misuari to condemn the killings of more than 60 Filipino Muslims and later became an aggressor against the government while the Moro Islamic Liberation Front ( MILF ), a splinter group from the MNLF, was established to seek an Islamic state within the Philippines and is more radical and more aggressive. Conflict dates back to 1899 during the uprising of the Bangsamoro people to resist foreign rule from the United States . Hostilities ignited again starting in the 1960s when the government started to resist upcoming rebellions by killing more than 60 Filipino Muslims and continues up to present. Casualty statistics vary for the conflict however the conservative estimates of the Uppsala Conflict Data Program indicate that at least 6,015 people were killed in armed conflict between the Government of Philippines and ASG , BIFM, MILF , and MNLF factions between 1989 and 2012. [26] Contents Fronts and captures in Basilan The Moros had a history of resistance against Spanish, American, and Japanese rule for 400 years. The origin of the war between the Moros and Filipinos started during the Spanish colonization of the Philippines. During the Spanish - Moro conflict , Spain repeatedly tried to conquer the Moro Sultanate of Sulu , Sultanate of Maguindanao , and the Confederation of sultanates in Lanao . The violent armed struggle against the Japanese, Filipinos, Spanish, and Americans is considered by current Moro Muslim leaders as part of the four centuries long "national liberation movement" of the Bangsamoro (Moro Nation). [27] The 400-year-long resistance against the Japanese, Americans, and Spanish by the Moro Muslims persisted and morphed into their current war for independence against the Philippine state. [28] Following the Spanish-American War in 1898, another conflict sparked in southern Philippines between the revolutionary Muslims in the Philippines and the United States Military that took place between 1899 and 1913. Filipinos opposed foreign rule from the United States that claimed the Philippines as their territory . On August 14, 1898, after defeating Spanish forces, the United States had established a military government in the Philippines under General Wesley Merritt as Military Governor . [29] American forces took control from the Spanish government in Jolo on May 18, 1899, and at Zamboanga in December 1899. [30] Brigadier General John C. Bates was sent to negotiate a treaty with the Sultan of Sulu , Jamalul Kiram II. Kiram was disappointed knowing that the American forces would take over since he expected to regain sovereignty after the defeat of Spanish forces in the archipelago. Bates' main goal was to guarantee Moro neutrality in the Philippine-American War , and to establish order in the southern Philippines. After some negotiation, the Bates Treaty was signed which was based on an earlier Spanish treaty. The Bates Treaty did ensure the neutrality of the Muslims in the south but it was actually set up to buy time for the Americans until the war in the north ended. On March 20, 1900, General Bates was replaced by Brigadier General William August Kobbe and the District of Mindanao-Jolo was upgraded to a full department. American forces in Mindanao were reinforced and hostilities with the Moro people lessened although there are reports of Americans and other civilians being attacked and slain by Moros. Insurrection began in 1900 and lasted for a year. The American forces then move push inside the settles of Moro people. Kobbe was replaced by George Whitefield Davis as the commander of the Department of Mindanao-Jolo and put up better relationships with the Moro people. It continued for more than three decades which resulted in significant loss of life.[ citation needed ] Military governors were appointed by the United States to ensure peace and stability within the region. The conflict ended at the term of Major General John J. Pershing , the third and final military governor of Moro Province, although major resistance continued in Bud Dajo and Mount Bagsak in Jolo . Repeated rebellions by the Moros against American rule continued to break out even after the main Moro Rebellion ended, right up to the Japanese occupation of the Philippines during World War II . During the Japanese invasion of the Philippines, the Moros waged an insurgency against the Japanese on Mindanao and Sulu until the Japanese were defeated and driven out. Marcos (1969 - 1986)[ edit ] Under President Ferdinand Marcos , 68 Filipino Muslim military trainees were murdered in Corregidor allegedly by soldiers of the Armed Forces of the Philippines . [31] [32] The trainees were believed to be a part of an upcoming rebellion. [32] By then, University of the Philippines professor Nur Misuari formed the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) to condemn the killings of the 68 Filipino Muslims and to seek the establishment of a Bangsamoro nation through force of arms. [32] Mindanao, the home of the Moro Muslims, is rich in natural resources and minerals. The American colonial government and subsequently the Philippine government followed a policy of demographic swamping by settling massive amounts of Filipino Christian settlers from the Visayan islands and Luzon onto Moro Muslim lands in Mindanao. The policy resulted in a massive wave of Filipino Christians settling on Mindanao where the population of Filipino Christian settlers now outnumbers the native Moro Muslims by the millions. This was an additional factor in aggravating conflicts between the native Moro Muslims and Filipino Christian settlers as disputes over land increased. Another complaint of the Moros is the extraction of Mindanao's natural resources and wealth by the central government while the Moro population live in mass poverty. In 1969, the MNLF waged armed conflict against the Philippine government . [32] During one of the fierce battles of the insurgency in 1974, Jolo was burned down and news of the tragedy galvanized other Muslims around the world to pay greater attention to the conflict. Over 10,000 Moro and Chinese civilians were killed by the Philippine Armed Forces when they burned Jolo to the ground. Two years later, the Philippine government and the MNLF signed the Tripoli Agreement, declaring ceasefire on both sides. Within the agreement provided that Mindanao would remain a part of the Philippines but 13 of its provinces would be under the autonomous government for the Bangsamoro people . [32] President Marcos went against the agreement and violence ensued. The Philippine government encouraged Filipino Christian settlers in Mindanao to form militias called Ilaga to fight the Moros. The Ilaga engaged in massacres and atrocities and were responsible for Manili massacre of 65 Moro Muslim civilians in a Mosque on June 1971, including women and children. The Ilaga also engaged in cannibalism, cutting off the body parts of their victims to eat in rituals. On September 24, 1974, in the Malisbong massacre the Armed Forces of the Philippines slaughtered 1,766 Moro Muslim civilians who were praying at a Mosque in addition to mass raping Moro girls who had been taken aboard a boat. In 1977, Shiekh Salamat Hashim established the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), a splinter group of the MNLF seeking to establish an Islamic state. [39] Conflicts between these rebel groups and the Armed Forces of the Philippines would continue until the end of the regime of President Marcos. C. Aquino and Ramos (1986 - 1998)[ edit ] Earlier in her term, President Corazon Aquino arranged a meeting with MNLF chairman Nur Misuari and several MNLF rebel groups in Sulu , which paved the way for a series of negotiations. In 1989, the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) was created under Republic Act No. 6734 or the ARMM Organic Act, pursuant to the 1987 Constitution . [40] In 1991, Abdurajak Janjalani, a former teacher who studied Islam in the Middle East , formed the Abu Sayyaf Group after reportedly meeting Osama bin Laden in Afghanistan in the 1980s. Janjalani recruited former members of the MNLF for the more radical and theocratic Abu Sayyaf. [32] Under the Presidency of Fidel V. Ramos , several negotiations and peace talks [25] were held and the ARMM was solidified and was to have its own geopolitical system. [32] The North Cotabato conflict (2000)[ edit ] Background 1000 MILF rebels under the command of Umbra Kato have seized control of thirty five villages in the North Cotabato province. 2000 Philippine troops with helicopters and artillery were sent in to the seized area on August 9 to liberate it from the rebels. The MILF had wanted North Cotabato to be included in the Autonomous Region of Muslim Mindanao . The government and MILF had been negotiating for the inclusion of the province in the Muslim Autonomous Region but the Supreme Court had struck down the proposal after hearing concern from local Christian leaders in the region. Conflict The rebel troops were ordered to leave the area by their commanders but the contingents under Kato refused to leave the villages they had occupied and instead dug in. The Philippine Army responded on August 9 by bombarding them. The next day, the government forces moved to retake the villages recapturing two of them from the rebels. [41] [42] Estrada and Arroyo (1998 - 2010)[ edit ] During his term President Joseph Ejercito Estrada he declared an "all-out war" against the MILF on March 21, 2000 although a series of negotiations for cessation of hostilities were held. [39] Apparently, several conflicts in and around Mindanao erupted and clashes between the Philippine Military and the rebel groups resulted in massive loss of lives. During his term, these rebel groups kidnapped three Italian priests, two were later released and one was shot dead; [43] [44] seized the municipal hall of Talayan , Maguindanao and Kauswagan , Lanao del Norte ; the bombing of the ferry Our Lady of Mediatrix at Ozamiz ; and the takeover of Narciso Ramos Highway. All these incidents resulted in massive loss of investments abroad, especially in the area of Mindanao . As a result, the Armed Forces of the Philippines launched a successful campaign against these rebel groups and 43 minor camps, 13 major camps including the MILF headquarters, and Camp Abubakar [45] fell. MILF suffered heavy losses and the head of MILF, Sheikh Salamat Hashim, fled the country and sought refuge in Malaysia . On October 5, 2000, 609 rebels surrendered in Cagayan de Oro , along with renegade town mayor Mulapandi Cosain Sarip. [46] These was followed by another massive surrender of 855 rebels on December 29, 2000. President Joseph Ejercito Estrada then ordered that the Philippine flag be raised in Mindanao which symbolized victory. It was raised on July 9, 2000 near a Madh'hab and again the next day along with President Joseph Ejercito Estrada , which held a feast inside a classroom just meters away from a mosque. [45] As a result, several Islamic rebel groups retaliated, bombing several key locations within the National Capital Region on December 30, 2000. It resulted in 22 deaths and hundreds of people injured. Saifullah Yunos, one of the perpetrators was arrested in Cagayan de Oro as he was about to board a plane bound to Manila in May 2003. [47] In 2004, two members of the Jemaah Islamiyah were arrested, namely Mamasao Naga and Abdul Pata as they were identified by Fathur Rahman al-Ghozi as responsible for the train bombing. [48] al-Ghozi was also arrested, but was later killed in a firefight when he tried to escape the prison on October 13, 2003. On May 27, 2001, the Abu Sayyaf seized twenty hostages from an upscale resort in Palawan . Four of the hostages managed to escape. [49] The kidnapping group composed of 40 gunmen then seized the Dr. Jose Torres Memorial Hospital and St. Peter's Church compound in the town of Lamitan in Basilan [50] and claimed to have taken captive 200 people although 20 people were confirmed to be taken captive inside the hospital, including the staff and the patients. [51] [52] There was a crossfire between the Army and the Abu Sayyaf rebels in Lamitan following the takeover of Dr. Jose Torres Memorial Hospital which resulted in the deaths of 12 soldiers, including the army captain. [52] Up to 22 soldiers were reportedly to have been killed in an effort to rescue the hostages. Five more captives escaped during the battle at Lamitan. Two of the captives were killed prior to the siege in Lamitan, including the beheading of one. [49] The Abu Sayyaf then conducted series of raids , including one at a coconut plantation [53] where the rebel groups hacked the heads of two men using bolo knives . The owners and a security guard was also held captive and the rebel groups burnt down two buildings, including a chapel a week after the battle in Lamitan . [53] Another raid was conducted in August 2, 2001 on Barangay Balobo in Lamitan , Basilan . After three days, the Philippine Army rescued numerous hostages [54] after they overtook the hideout of the militants where 11 bodies were found beheaded. [55] Other hostages were either released or had escaped. [54] On June 13, 2001, the number of hostages was calculated at around 28 as three more people were found beheaded in Basilan , [56] including that of Guillermo Sobero. [57] They were beheaded since the Philippine Army would not halt the rescue operation. [57] The Burhams were still on the group of 14 still held captive according to three hostages who escaped on October 2001. [57] On June 7, 2002, after a year of being held captive, a rescue mission was conducted and resulted in the deaths of Martin Burnham and a nurse named Ediborah Yap [58] after being caught in the crossfire. Martin was killed by three gunshots in the chest while Gracia was wounded in her right leg. By this time Nur Misuari ordered his supporters to attack government targets to prevent the holding of elections on ARMM on November 2001, ushering his exit as the governor of the region. [32] Misuari would be later arrested in 2007 in Malaysia and was deported back to the Philippines for trial. [32] On July 2004, Gracia Burnham testified at a trial of eight Abu Sayyaf members and identified six of the suspects as being her erstwhile captors, including Alhamzer Limbong, Abdul Azan Diamla, Abu Khari Moctar, Bas Ishmael, Alzen Jandul and Dazid Baize. Fourteen Abu Sayyaf members were sentenced to life imprisonment while four were acquitted . Alhamzer Limbong was later killed in a prison uprising . [59] Since 2001, the Philippines and the United States have been on a campaign to battle this insurgency, known as War on Terror . To combat the insurgency, the United States and the Philippines conducted the Operation Enduring Freedom - Philippines , [61] a part of the worldwide campaign against terrorism known as Operation Enduring Freedom . Benigno Aquino III (2010 - present)[ edit ] In 2013, two main camps of the Abu Sayyaf group were overrun by forces of the Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) in its latest offensive in Patikul . [62] According to MNLF leader Nur Misuari, the MNLF offensive against the Abu Sayyaf is because of the MNLF opposition to the Abu Sayyafs human rights abuses which goes against Islam . During the term of President Benigno Aquino III , a series of peace talks for the cessation of hostilities was held, including the meeting of MILF Chair Al Haj Murad Ibrahim in Tokyo , Japan which was lauded on both sides. [32] Norway also joined the International Monitoring Team (IMT) on January 2011, overseeing the ceasefire agreement between the government and MILF on Mindanao . Despite the peace talks, a series of conflicts erupted. on September 10, 2011, Jal Idris, a hardcore member of Abu Sayyaf , was arrested by government forces after a crossfire between the Philippine Army and the rebel group [63] The Armed Forces of the Philippines also killed three Abu Sayyaf militants in a stand-off [64] the following day after the arrest of Jal Idris. Terrorism continued throughout President Benigno's term, notable cases include when 4 merchants and a guide were killed by Abu Sayyaf bandits in January 2011. [65] and later a soldier who was killed in a clash against the rebels. [66] In August 2011, rebel factions attacked a village in Sulu , killing 7 Marines and taking 7 civilians captive. They later freed 2 of the hostages after a ransom was paid. [67] Also, several areas of Mindanao were bombed in August by the government, and a Filipino businesswoman was abducted in September 2011 [68] who was later freed after the three gunmen were gunned down by the Armed Forces of the Philippines . [69] On October 20, 2011, the MILF was blamed for an attack on 40 government soldiers in the province of Basilan , which lead to the deaths of 19 soldiers and 6 MILF fighters. [70] This thereby violated the ceasefire agreement between the government and MILF. This caused outrage in the government, which lead to the continuation of the war against terrorism in the country . On the website of the Moro National Liberation Front, Nur Misuari declared its support for China against the Philippines, in the South China Sea dispute , calling both China and the Moro people as victims of Philippine colonialism, and noting China's history of friendly relations with the Moros. [71] The MNLF website also denounced America's assistance to the Philippines in their colonization of the Moro people in addition to denouncing the Philippines claims to the islands disputed with China, and denouncing America for siding with the Philippines in the dispute, noting that in 1988 China "punished" Vietnam for attempting to set up a military presence on the disputed islands. The website also pointed out that the Moros and China maintained peaceful relations, while on the other hand the Moros had to resist other colonial powers, having to fight the Spanish , fight the Americans , and fight the Japanese , in addition to fighting the Philippines. [72] The Zamboanga City crisis erupted on September 9, 2013, when a MNLF faction known by other groups as the Rogue MNLF Elements (RME), under the Sulu State Revolutionary Command (SSRC), led by Ustadz Habier Malik and Khaid Ajibon attempted to raise the flag of the self-proclaimed Bangsamoro Republik at Zamboanga City Hall (which had earlier declared its independence on August 12, 2013 in Talipao, Sulu), and took civilians hostage. This armed incursion was met by the Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) and the Philippine National Police (PNP), which sought to free the hostages and expel the MNLF from the city. The standoff degenerated into urban warfare, and had brought parts of the city under a standstill for days. On September 28, the government declared the end of military operations in Zamboanga City after successfully defeating the MNLF and rescuing all the hostages. On January 24, 2014, the Philippines government chief negotiator Miriam Coronel Ferer and MILF chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal signed a peace agreement in Kuala Lumpur . The agreement would pave the way for the creation of the new Muslim autonomous entity called "Bangsamoro" under a law to be approved by the Philippine Congress. [73] The government aims to set up the region by 2016. The agreement calls for Muslim self-rule in parts of the southern Philippines in exchange for a deactivation of rebel forces by the MILF. MILF forces would turn over their firearms to a third party to be selected by the MILF and the Philippine government. A regional police force would be established, and the Philippine military would reduce the presence of troops and help disband private armies in the area. [74] On July 23, 2014, Abu Sayyaf leader Isnilon Hapilon swore loyalty to Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi in a video, along with the rest of the organization, giving ISIL a presence in the Philippines. [16] [17] In September 2014, the group began kidnapping people to ransom, in the name of ISIL. [75] ^ "Khadafy admits aiding Muslim seccesionists".

question:In which city was Noordin Top killed?
answer:
 Terrorism Mastermind Noordin Top Killed In this combination file photo released by Indonesian National Police, Malaysian terror suspect Noordin Mohammad Top is seen with the most recent picture on the right. Police hunting Noordin, one of Asia's top terror suspects, surrounded a house in central Java, Indonesia and were exchanging gunfire with suspected militants holed up inside it Friday Aug 7 2009, police and a witness said. (AP Photo/Indonesian National Police, HO, File) AP Police hunting for suspects in Jakarta hotel bombings raided a hide-out in central Indonesia, sparking gunfire and an explosion Thursday that left four suspected militants dead, including Noordin, national police Chief Bambang Hendarso Danuri said. Three alleged terrorists also were captured. Noordin's remains were found in the house on the outskirts of the town of Solo in central Java after the hours-long gunfight, he said. Fingerprints of Noordin's stored on a police database matched those of the body, Danuri said. DNA tests have not yet been conducted. "It is Noordin M. Top," he told a nationally televised news conference to loud cheers from the audience. Documents and laptop computers confiscated from the house prove that Noordin "is the leader of al Qaeda in Southeast Asia," he said. Hundreds of pounds (kilograms) of explosives, M-16 assault rifles, grenades and bombs were removed from the house as ambulances shuttled away the dead and injured. "We asked Noordin M. Top to surrender, but they kept firing," Danuri said. "That is how he died . he even had bullets in his pockets." Noordin, a Malaysian citizen, fled to Indonesia in 2002 amid a crackdown on Muslim extremists in Malaysia in the wake of the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States. He was linked to bombings on the Indonesian resort island of Bali in 2002 and 2005 that together killed 222 people, mostly foreigners. "The most dangerous terrorist in Southeast Asia has been put out of commission," said Jim Della-Giacoma, Southeast Asia project director for the International Crisis Group think tank. "It would have been better if police had managed to arrest him alive, but it appears that this was not an option," he said. "Unfortunately, Noordin's death does not mean an end to terrorism in Indonesia, though it has been dealt a significant blow." Noordin, who is accused of heading a splinter group of the al Qaeda-funded regional terror group Jemaah Islamiyah, has been implicated in every major attack in Indonesia since 2003, including a pair of suicide bombings at Jakarta's J.W. Marriott and Ritz-Carlton hotels in July that killed seven people and wounded more than 50. He is also blamed for an earlier attack on the J.W. Marriott in 2003 and a bombing at the Australian Embassy in 2004. A counterterrorism official said the militants killed Thursday included alleged bomb-maker Bagus Budi Pranato. The captured militants included a pregnant woman who is being treated at a hospital, national police spokesman Nanan Sukarna said. She was in stable condition. Police tracked the seven suspects to the town of Solo and besieged a village house on its outskirts overnight. The raid ended near daybreak when an explosion occurred inside the home, Sukarna said. The operation left behind a charred house with no roof and blown-out walls. The bodies were flown to Jakarta for autopsies. 2009 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.
