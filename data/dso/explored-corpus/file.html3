About 50 miles off the coast of Yemen , the cargo ship S Venus was moving through the Gulf of Aden when a small boat with several pirates started to pursue it. The ship sent a distress call to a nearby French Frigate , the Premier-Maître L'Her [2] that was part of an international task group sent to Somalia to help stop and deter piracy. The approaching frigate scared off the pirates, but several hours later they tried again to approach the ship. That time, the French frigate captured and boarded the boat. French forces then arrested eight men. They also found a rocket launcher, assault rifles and several boarding ladders on the pirates' vessel. According to a French spokesperson, the eight men captured would be taken to Somalia for their trial. [3]

A small fishing vessel was attacked off the Somali coast, with a crew of 4 Kenyans and 3 Indian sailors. [10] The pirates attacked the vessel which was anchored at the Kenyan harbor of Kiunga , 18km from the Somali border. Three people of Somali origin came in a fast skiff during the night and boarded the ship, kidnapping the three Indian crew members and mysteriously leaving the Kenyan crew unharmed. [15] The pirates also left the ship unharmed and did not remove it from its anchorage. The ship belongs to a Kenyan company known as the Southern Engineering Company, which is part of the Alpha Group, known to be fishing illegally in Somali waters. It is possible that the kidnapping was a revenge attack targeting the company and its fishermen, also possibly involving the Kenyan sailors who may have been working with the kidnappers.

1995
The 2010 Moscow Metro bombings were suicide bombings carried out by two women during the morning rush hour of March 29, 2010, at two stations of the Moscow Metro ( Lubyanka and Park Kultury ), with roughly 40 minutes interval between. At least 40 people were killed, and over 100 injured.
Russian officials called the incident "the deadliest and most sophisticated terrorist attack in the Russian capital in six years", [5] a reference to the Avtozavodskaya and Rizhskaya bombings in 2004. At the time of the attacks, an estimated 500,000 people were commuting through Moscow's metro system. [6]
Initial investigation indicated that the bombings were perpetrated by the Islamist [7] [8] Chechen terrorists of the Caucasus Emirate. [8] [9] On March 31, Chechen terrorist leader Doku Umarov confirmed suspicions when he claimed responsibility for ordering the attacks in a video released on the internet. He has also stated that such attacks in Russia will continue unless Russia grants independence to Muslim states in the North Caucasus region. [10] The man who brought the suicide bombers to Moscow was arrested in July 2010. [11] The Anti-Terror Committee of Russia confirmed in August 2010 that Magomedali Vagabov , along with four other militants, was killed in an operation in Dagestan. He is believed to be a militant behind the bombings, a close associate of Doku Umarov and the husband of Mariam Sharipova, one of the two suicide bombers. [12]
Contents
The bombings were the latest in a series of attacks in Russia since 1994, many attributed to Chechen terrorists or to the " Caucasus Emirate ". [13] Since 1999, Chechen separatists gradually shifted away from a pro-western terroristic approach of the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria , strongly influenced by Wahhabi beliefs which placed them at odds not only with Russia and Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov , but also with a Dagestani population with strong Sufi traditions. [14] [15] A mujahideen group [7] [8] [14] [16] claim they are fighting a " holy war ", [17] and wish to create an "Emirate" in the Caucasus. [18] Over 5,000 people have been killed and wounded in the Caucasus since 2002. [19]
About 48 hours after the Moscow Metro bombings a double suicide bombing hit the Caucasian Republic of Dagestan , killing the city police chief amongst others. Russia immediately drew parallels, saying the two bombings were linked. [20] On April 1 another bombing in Dagestan killed two more people. [21] On April 5, exactly a week after the Moscow attacks, another bombing in Ingushetia targeting a police barracks drew parallels between that and the Dagestan attacks. It was seen as a fear that these incidents lead to an escalation of violence as a whole. [22]
Locations of the attacks on a metro map
The first explosion occurred on the Red Arrow – 75 years train at the Lubyanka station at approximately 7:56 am local time (3:56 am UTC ). The train started from Yugo-Zapadnaya , and stopped at Lubyanka station. Once the train doors opened, explosives worn by a woman standing at the second carriage's second exit detonated. The explosive had a force of up to 1.5 kg of trinitrotoluene (TNT). [23] Fifteen people on board the train, and eleven people on the platform were killed. One victim from the third carriage died from a head injury caused by an 8 mm (0.31 in) piece of metal. [24]
A second explosion at the Park Kultury station followed at approximately 8:38 am, caused by another female, who at the time of the first explosion was riding another train from Sokolniki station in the same direction. At the time of first explosion, the second train had stopped between Frunzenskaya and Park Kultury stations. It was announced over the speakers that due to technical problems, the train would have to unload the passengers at the next stop. About 40 minutes later, the train reached the station, and once its doors opened, the second female suspect detonated the second explosion, killing fourteen commuters. [24] Panic included stampedes at both stations, as commuters attempted to escape. [9] The second attack was carried out by a dark-haired woman with the equivalent of 2 kg of TNT strapped to her waist. Both bombs were packed with metal nuts, bolts and screws, to increase the destructive impact of the blasts. [25] [26]

The two women who carried out the attacks wore explosive belts, presumably using detonation devices set inside their mobile phones and activated by a call to self. [27] The attackers intended to strike during peak hours on a weekday when the subway would be at capacity. Eyewitnesses said that some survivors were so badly injured that they constantly splashed heavy amounts of blood on the floor and walls, until they were attended to by doctors. [28]
Alexander Bortnikov , the FSB chief, said its investigation pointed to "terrorist groups related to the North Caucasus ". [29]

At least 39 people, aged between 16 and 65, were killed in the explosions. [31] A 40th victim died of her injuries on March 30. [32] [33] This figure was revised upwards from an earlier count of 36 killed, that had consisted of 24 people in the explosion at the Lubyanka station and 12 at Park Kultury. Two other people died in the resulting stampede at both the stations after the blast. Three of the dead were minors. [34]
A high-ranking official of the Black Sea Fleet of the Russian Federation, Captain Viktor Ginkut, was also amongst the passengers killed at Park Kultury station. [35] His residential registry in Sevastopol , Ukraine has raised the question of his actual nationality, but Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia refused to comment on it. [36]
Over 100 other passengers sustained mild to serious injuries. [9] [27] Five of the injured passengers remained in critical condition for an extended period.
Subsequent false alarms[ edit ]
A third reportedly failed detonation was announced by Life News roughly 40 minutes later, aimed at one of the two Prospekt Mira stations; however, no explosives were found in the plastic bag, after it was taken from the station. [37] Around 10:04 am local time a call from a public phone announcing another planned explosion was made to the Begovaya station staff, but the caller soon revealed it to be a hoax. [38]
Another hoax occurred about an hour after the second explosion at the Ulitsa Podbelskogo station when passengers noticed a Muslim woman entering the train. [39] [40]
Overcrowded surface public transport lines on the day of the bombings
Russian television carried little coverage of the attacks for the first hour after the first explosion took place (at 7:57 am). Commentators have criticised this, alleging that it spread more panic and led to citizens feeling helpless. [41] [42]
Around 11:00 am local time, a special operation was launched to patrol all the subway stations in search of possible clues to trace the instigators. Squads of local police performed passport control at every station of the Sokolnicheskaya Line . [43]
Commuters leave flowers at the Lubyanka station
Russia's Interior Ministry head Rashid Nurgaliyev said security was being boosted across the country, "in particular in those cities with metro systems." [44] March 30 was declared a nationwide Day of Mourning. [45] Prime Minister Vladimir Putin issued a decree ordering the allocation from the Reserve Fund of 300,000 rubles (approx. $11,000 USD) to the families of those killed in the bombings, plus 18,000 rubles for funeral expenses, and of 50,000–100,000 rubles to those who were injured in the attacks, depending on the severity of their injuries. [46] [47]
Authorities have announced that due to upcoming Easter (Paskha), May 1 International Workers Day and May 9 Victory Day , strict security would be imposed on Moscow's metro network up until May 15, 2010. [48] As a result of the terror bombings, the number of daily commuters in the Moscow metro decreased by 17% the next day. [49]
the Moscow metro bombings
According to Interfax news agency, citing law enforcement sources, surveillance cameras captured two women – aged between 18 and 20 – boarding the metro at the Yugo-Zapadnaya station. Police were hunting for one 30-year-old man with North Caucasian features, and two other women of Slavic appearance aged 22 and 45 who had been seen shepherding the bombers into the station. [6] All had their faces uncovered. [50]
Unconfirmed reports said the perpetrators tried to take the explosives to the Russian Ministry of Defense building on Arbat street . [45] Law enforcement also speculated the suicide bombers may have confused the stations, missing one of their original targets – Oktyabrskaya station. They opine that the attackers intended to blow up the Lubyanka station, which is located next to central headquarters of FSB , and then Oktyabrskaya, which is attached to the Ministry of Internal Affairs . [51] Officials suspect that Muslim rebels from the troubled North Caucasus region that includes Chechnya are responsible for the attack. [9] [37] [52] The link to the Caucasian group [53] [54] was immediate. According to preliminary reports, law enforcement were notified about possible terror acts through three telegrams indicating potential threats to Moscow's transport system, but the suicide bombers passed through the security. Unofficial reports the morning before the attacks took place indicate many female passengers of North Caucasian appearance were stopped and checked by Moscow security enforcement under pretence of routine ID verifications, and taken to local precincts. [24]
Commuters leave flowers at the Park Kultury station
The Investigation Committee of the Procuracy of the Russian Federation started a criminal investigation under Article 205 of the Russian Criminal Code ("act of terrorism"). [55]
Two female natives of Daghestan are believed to have detonated the explosions. Russian authorities released photographs of both women, showing their facial features to be intact and possibly identifiable. [56] [57] Russia's FSB security service have named the suicide bomber behind the Park Kultury metro station explosion [58] as Dzhanet Abdullayeva (1992-2010), "black widow" who had lived in the Khasavyurtsky region of Dagestan. [56] She was the widow of 30-year-old Umalat Magomedov, a prominent insurgent killed by Russian forces on December 31, 2009. [59] Investigators confirmed that the second attacker was Maryam Sharipova, a 28-year-old schoolteacher from Dagestan, after her father identified her body [60] although he claimed she had a degree in mathematics and psychology and taught computer science while never expressing any "radical beliefs." Although there was some speculation as to whether her brother had been arrested in connection to North Caucassian fighters. [3] [61] Police had identified an apartment rented out by two suspected accomplices of the bombers. The men were believed to have accompanied the women to a metro station in the southwest of the city and handed over the bomb belts. They then went back to the apartment where they were said to have remotely detonated the charges. The two were known to police who have put them on a wanted list. [58]
Moscow said that there were an additional twenty-one "black widows" ready to strike, and were studying if the alleged attackers were part of an original group of thirty. [62] Female suicide bombers , known as "black widows," have been involved in suicide bombings on numerous occasions, including 2004 bombings of two passenger planes that took off from Domodedovo International Airport , previous Moscow metro bombings, the Moscow theater hostage crisis , and the Beslan school hostage crisis . [56]
The Caucasus Emirate immediately denied responsibility for the attack, saying that they planned attacks on economic targets inside Russia, but not against civilians. However, the attack followed a warning from Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov the prior month of his intent to spread the Caucasian insurgency to Russian cities. [62]

On May 13, FSB director Aleksandr Bortnikov announced that they had identified all members of the group behind the attack and that three of the members were killed during a raid in an attempt to detain them, one of them being the person who escorted the suicide bombers from Dagestan to Moscow. [65] Bortnikov was quoted as saying: "To our great regret, we were unable to detain them alive because they put up fierce armed resistance and were killed." [66]
Following the attacks, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin as well as Ramzan Kadyrov , President of the Chechen Republic , were quick to comment on the attacks. The heads of Russia's three biggest religious bodies also condemned the attacks and called for justice. The Russian Council of Muftis said that "extremism and terrorism have no basis in the Holy Qur'an ," and added that "a terrorist cannot be a Muslim while a Muslim cannot be a terrorist." [67] Russia's chief rabbi , Berel Lazar , said he was sure the masterminds of the terrorist attack would get the punishment they deserved. [67]
The attack also sparked condemnation and expressions of condolence from numerous governments and heads of state, as well as international bodies such as NATO , the Council of Europe , and the European Union who also condemned the attacks and/or expressed condolences to the victims' families. [68] [69]
Amongst media reactions, there was controversy about how the Russian media handled the reporting in the first hours after the attack. Outside Russia, the United States increased security and police presence on transit systems in New York City, Washington, D.C., Chicago, and Atlanta following the attacks. [70]

The reactions to the 2010 Moscow Metro bombings were both national and international. Russian official reaction included both strong condemnations and promises of retaliation against the perpetrators. International reaction was swift and widespread, with many countries and organizations condemning the attack and expressing their condolences to the victims.

G8 On behalf of the G8 Canadian Foreign Minister, Lawrence Cannon, "G8 foreign ministers today strongly condemned the cowardly terrorist attacks on the Moscow subway that took place earlier this morning, and which have killed numerous innocent civilians and injured dozens more. [The] Ministers expressed their deepest sympathy to all who have been injured or bereaved by these attacks, and called for the prosecution of all those responsible." In response, the G8 ministers said they would "continue to collaborate to thwart and constrain terrorists, and to work for a world that is safe for all, based on the principles of democracy, and respect for the rule of law and for human rights." [2]
Secretary General of the Council of Europe , Thorbjørn Jagland , said the attack was an attack on the whole of Europe, and that the terrorists' target was freedom, democracy and the supremacy of law, which are the priority values of the Council of Europe. [3]
 EU – Head of the European Commission , José Manuel Barroso , strongly condemned the blasts and offered his condolences to the families and friends of those killed and said the EU intends to cooperate with Russia in fighting terrorism. [3] Herman Van Rompuy , the president of the EU , also sent Medvedev a message of solidarity and condolence. [1]
Interpol - Interpol has also extended its help to Russia to track down the plotters behind what it called "despicable and senseless attacks." Jean-Michel Louboutin, the executive director of Interpol, said: "[We have] offered every support and made available all of [our] resources to the Russian authorities in their investigation into these attacks." [1]
 NATO – Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen condemned the attacks saying there can be no justification for terrorist attacks against innocent civilians. He also expressed condolences to the victims' families and wished for a quick recovery to the wounded. He said NATO stays committed to cooperation with Russia in fighting international terrorism. [4]
 Russia
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev said: "We will continue the operation against terrorists without hesitation and to the end. It is difficult to prevent such terrorist attacks and to provide security on transport. It is necessary to tighten what we do, to look at the problem on a national scale, not only relating to a certain populated area but on a national scale. Obviously, what we have done before is not enough." [5] After an emergency meeting he ordered senior officials to fight terrorism "without hesitation, to the end." Stating that "The policy to suppress terrorism in our country and the fight with terrorism will be continued." He said Russia would act without compromise to root out terrorists and ordered security to be boosted across the country. "We will carry out uncompromising operations against terrorists to the end." While he opined that human rights must be respected during police operations., [6] he also ordered new laws to combat militant attacks urging for steps to make law-enforcement agencies work more efficiently, to increase the safety of transport systems and public places and to improve the implementation of Russia's anti-terrorism statutes. [7] He also promised "crueller" measures to crack down on such attackers. [1]
Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin added: "It is well known that today a terrible crime against civilians in its effects and disgusting in its character was carried out ... I am sure that police will do their best to find and punish the criminals. The terrorists will be destroyed." [8] He vowed to "drag out of the sewer" the organisers of the bombings. [1]
Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov said: "Terror attacks were staged in Moscow. People died and were injured. Again terrorism bids defiance to the state, [to the] society. The organizers and executors, whoever they are, are trying to spark chaos, drive Russia into the abyss of fear, distrust, undermine its economy. There should be no indifferent people in the fight against this evil. Evil does not choose its victims on the basis of national, religious, or racial traits ..."During this difficult day for Russia's peoples, we declare with all responsibility that [we] will fight against terrorists until they are completely destroyed. It is impossible to eradicate evil just by persuasion," he said, adding those guilty of the attacks "should be found and punished." [9]
The Council of Muftis said "extremism and terrorism have no basis in the Holy Quran." They also added that "a terrorist cannot be a Muslim while a Muslim cannot be a terrorist." [10]
Russia's chief rabbi, Berel Lazar , said he was sure the masterminds of the terrorist attack would get the punishment they deserved. [10]
Russian Orthodox Patriarch Kirill of Moscow and All Russia called for solidarity in the face of the tragedy and condemned not only the terrorists but also those who have tried to profit from human grief. "I've just been told that taxi drivers have raised their prices several times just because people are unable to use the metro. This money will do you no good." [10]
The Moscow city government declared the next day, Tuesday, as a day of mourning. Groups of Russians amassed at the two sites of the attacks lighting candles and laying flowers in memory of those killed. Medvedev also laid a wreath of red roses at one of the sites and called the plotters "wild beasts," while pledging to find and wipe them out. [11]
 Abkhazia President of Abkhazia, Sergei Bagapsh , "I am deeply shaken by the news about explosions in the Moscow subway which have carried away lives of dozens of innocent people. On behalf of the people of Abkhazia and from myself personally I express deep condolences to you, to the families of the victims of this inhuman in its cruelty act of terror.

Director of Amnesty International's Europe and Central Asia Programme Halya Gowan stated that "There can be no justification for such vicious attacks on the lives of civilians and those who are responsible for it should be apprehended and brought to justice strictly in line with international human rights standards. The Russian authorities must also ensure human rights are respected in their response to the attack." [41]
Human Rights Watch stated that "nothing can justify" the attacks, and that they "represent an assault on the fundamental principle of respect for civilian life, and those responsible for this crime need to be found and held accountable".

[42]
Security and a police presence on the New York City subway system were increased in the aftermath of the bombings in Moscow. [43]
Russian television carried little coverage of the attacks for the first hour after the first explosion took place (at 7:57 am). Commentators have criticised this, alleging that it spread more panic and led to citizens feeling helpless. [44]
Other media outlets continued to make a link to the War in Afghanistan . Speculation continued as to militants from Central Asia have joined hands to fight the spy agencies conceived to be their main adversary. This followed an attack by a Jordanian militant who infiltrated the ranks to attack the CIA in Afghanistan. [45]

Moscow Metro Bombings | World History Project The 2010 Moscow Metro bombings were suicide bombings carried out by two women during the morning rush hour of March 29, 2010, at two stations of the Moscow Metro ... Mar 29 2010
Moscow Metro Bombings
With a pair of powerful blasts on Moscow subway cars that killed at least 38 people Monday, two female suicide bombers shattered Prime Minister Vladimir Putin's claim to have contained a separatist insurgency in Russia's southwest and forced the nation's capital to brace for a terrorist comeback after several years of calm.
The explosions occurred about 45 minutes apart at downtown stations during the morning rush hour. They followed triumphant reports in recent weeks that Russian security forces had killed several top leaders of the Islamist rebel movement, which seeks to establish a fundamentalist state in the North Caucasus region.
Prime Minister Vladimir Putin, who cemented his power in 1999 by launching a war to crush Chechen separatism, broke off a trip to Siberia, declaring "terrorists will be destroyed".
Witnesses described panic at two central Moscow stations after the blasts, with morning commuters falling over each other in dense smoke and dust as they tried to escape the worst attack on the Russian capital in six years.
At least 72 others were injured, many gravely, and officials said the death toll could rise. Russia's top security official said the bombs were filled with bolts and iron rods.
At least 38 people were killed and more than 60 injured in two suicide bomb attacks on the Moscow Metro during the morning rush hour, officials say.
Female suicide bombers are believed to have carried out the attacks on trains that had stopped at two stations in the heart of the Russian capital.
No group has yet claimed responsibility for being behind the attacks.
But Russian security services believe the bombers are linked to militant groups in the North Caucasus region.
The 2010 Moscow Metro bombings were suicide bombings carried out by two women during the morning rush hour of March 29, 2010, at two stations of the Moscow Metro (Lubyanka and Park Kultury), with roughly 40 minutes interval between. At least 40 people were killed, and over 100 injured.
Russian officials called the incident "the deadliest and most sophisticated terrorist attack in the Russian capital in six years", a reference to the Avtozavodskaya and Rizhskaya bombings in 2004. At the time of the attacks, an estimated 500,000 people were commuting through Moscow's metro system.
Initial investigation indicated that the bombings were perpetrated by the Islamist Chechen separatists of the Caucasus Emirate. On March 31, Chechen rebel leader Doku Umarov confirmed suspicions when he claimed responsibility for ordering the attacks in a video released on the internet. He added that such attacks in Russia would continue. The man who brought the suicide bombers to Moscow was arrested in July 2010. The Anti-Terror Committee of Russia confirmed in August 2010 that Magomedali Vagabov, along with four other militants, was killed in an operation in Dagestan. He is believed to be a militant behind the bombings, a close associate of Doku Umarov and the husband of Mariam Sharipova, one of the two suicide bombers.

On the same day of the attacks, the United States of America's Central Intelligence Agency 's drones killed four people said to be "militants" in the wider tribal area. [1]
A suicide bomber who was said to have been a teenage boy exploded his vest at a mosque in the Ghundai area of Khyber Agency. The mosque was in an area inhabited by Kokikhel tribes who have been opposed to the Taliban activities and have fought to expel them from the region. Mutahir Zeb, a regional government administrator, said that the attack could have been in retaliation and that "many of the wounded succumbed to their injuries, adding to the toll that may rise further as there are still people in critical condition." Khalid Mumtaz Kundi, the deputy chief of the district administration, said that the suicide bomber was wearing 8–10 kg of explosives and was on foot when he exploded his vest in the prayer hall; he also said that ball bearings were used in the attack. According to Al Jazeera the whole mosque compound collapsed with many more worshippers buried under the rubble.
Though no one laid claim to the attack, the Pakistani Taliban were suspected. According to Al Jazeera however, Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan's factions said that they do not carry out attacks on mosques. [2]
President Asif Ali Zardari condemned the blast and reiterated the government's stance on dealing with militants "with iron hands;" he added that all those who perpetrate such attacks are inhumane.
Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani also expressed his condemnation and directed the provincial Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa to provide the best medical care possible to victims, at the expense of the state. [5]
Chief Minister of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Ameer Haider Khan Hoti condemned the blast and termed it as an unhumane and un-Islamic act in the holy month of Ramadan . Expressing grief over the loss of lives, he expressed solidarity with the relatives of the deceased and ordered the administration of local hospitals to ensure ready facilities for the treatment of the injured. [6]
Imran Khan , chairman of the Tehreek-e-Insaaf party, condemned the blasts and attacked the government, accusing it of having badly failed in protecting the people of Pakistan. [7]
The Jamat-e-Islami also condemned the blast, with Syed Munawar Hasan and Liaqat Baloch issuing a joint statement in which they called the bombing a coward and inhumane act "by the enemies of the country and Islam ." They also expressed sympathies with families who had lost their relatives and prayed for the peace of those who had been killed and injured in the bombing. [8]
  United States – Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that "The slaughter of worshippers as they gathered at a mosque for Ramadan's Friday prayers underscores the brutality of those who would target civilians during a time of celebration and reflection for Muslims throughout the world. Our thoughts and prayers are with the families and loved ones affected by this deplorable violence. The United States deeply respects Pakistan's sacrifices in the fight against extremism and we continue to stand with Pakistan against those who seek to undermine democracy." [1]

2010 Philippine Bar exam bombing - Wikipedia, the free ... 2010 Philippine Bar exam bombing; Centennial celebration; Brothers: Hyacinth Gabriel Connon; Rolando Dizon; Rafael Donato; Crescentius Richard Duerr; Andrew Gonzalez; Police comb the debris for evidence

The 2010 Philippine Bar exam bombing occurred on Taft Avenue near De La Salle University (DLSU), located in Malate , Manila , Philippines, on September 26, 2010, at 5:05 pm PST , a few minutes after Philippine Bar examinees began exiting DLSU. An Mk2 grenade was thrown at a group of Alpha Phi Beta members from San Beda College . They were standing near Tau Gamma Phi members, who police believed were the real target of the explosive. This resulted in injuries to 47 people, including two who required amputations.
Jed Carlos Lazaga was initially accused of throwing the grenade, based on information received by the Manila Police District (MPD) from an unnamed witness. This theory was later dismissed when the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) took over the case.
Anthony Leal Nepomuceno, NBI's prime suspect and an Alpha Phi Omega (APO) member, surrendered to Jejomar Binay , Vice President of the Philippines , on October 27. Fellow APO members, Binay, and former Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Silvestre Bello III , asserted Nepomuceno's innocence. Binay's actions were criticized by several members of the House of Representatives of the Philippines , who said Nepomuceno was cleared prematurely. The Office of the President stated that it had no intention to distance Binay from the matter, but clarified that Binay's statements would have no bearing in the investigation.
In a 27-page DOJ resolution, prosecutors found Nepomuceno's defense "weak", and recommended his indictment . DOJ charged him with multiple murder charges (for almost killing the two amputees), multiple attempted murder charges, and illegal possession of explosives.
The 2010 Bar exam was the last to be conducted in De La Salle University. The 2011 exam will be held in the University of Santo Tomas (UST) in November. The Supreme Court denied that the bombing precipitated the move; the change had already been planned before the blast. It also said that "necessary security measures" will be in force in UST to prevent an event similar to the 2010 bombing.

Velasco Hall, one of the buildings used during the Bar exams
De La Salle University is a private La Sallian university located on a 5.45 ha (13.5-acre) campus [1] in Malate, Manila, Philippines. It faces Taft Avenue, a major thoroughfare named after William Howard Taft . DLSU had a population of 888 [2] faculty and 15,779 [3] [4] students in 2009.
The Philippine Bar exams have been held at DLSU since 2002. [5] [6] An average of over 5,000 examinees used its buildings for the test. [7] For the 2010 exam, 5,012 examinees took the test in 121 rooms inside six DLSU buildings. The number of examinees was lower than the 6,080 who took the test in 2009. [8]
Incident and response[ edit ]
The bar exam ended at 5 pm PST . As with tradition, examinees were expected to be greeted by loud noises as they exit DLSU. [9] By 5:05 pm, a loud explosion occurred in the area where supporters for the San Beda College examinees were standing. Tremors were felt as far away as inside the elevated platform of the Vito Cruz LRT Station near DLSU. People in the area thought that the noise from the explosion was from fireworks that are a normal part of the post-bar celebrations. A commotion followed as people panicked and ran for safety. A bottle-throwing incident also occurred, according to a police spokesman. [10] [11] The window of a street-side shop was shattered. Glass bottles, broken and intact, were scattered around the area as police evacuated people from the scene. The explosion occurred shortly after a fraternity fight near DLSU. [12]
On the day of the explosion, 34 injuries were reported. This figure rose to 47 two days later. [13] Most of the victims were female and members of Alpha Phi Beta, a fraternity from San Beda. [14] Victims who were identified were from 23 to 28 years old. Ospital ng Maynila Medical Center received 17 of the injured; nine were taken to the Philippine General Hospital , five to Medical Center Manila , three to the Manila Doctors Hospital , and one to the Manila Adventist Medical Center . [10] [15] The Manila Police District bomb squad rushed to the site of the blast and cordoned off the area to search the debris for parts of the explosive. [11]
Two persons (Raissa Laurel and Joanna Ledda; [9] both women) underwent leg amputations because of their injuries. [13]
We, legitimate fraternities based in major universities and colleges as well as communities nationwide, joins [ sic ] the Filipino nation in condemning in the strongest possible terms the brutal act of indiscriminate violence, which occurred during street revelry along Taft Avenue marking the end of this year’s bar examinations at the De La Salle University. We denounce this gross display of brutality, which caused severe injury to innocent people and damage to property.
The bombing was condemned by the Supreme Court of the Philippines , who called it "an unfortunate incident." [17] The incident was likewise condemned by San Beda Rector Aloysius Maranan, [18] Akbayan Youth Chairperson Marlon Cornelio, and Negros fraternities . [19] Several members of six fraternities gathered at Quezon City on October 1 to participate in a candlelighting event and express their sympathies. [16]
Renato Corona , Chief Justice of the Supreme Court , said in a statement that he had already ordered the Supreme Court security, the MPD, and the National Bureau of Investigation (NBI) to investigate the matter and "to identify the perpetrators of this senseless act of cowardice, and bring them to the bar of justice." He also ordered a review of the security protocol. Task Force Bar Operations 2010 was created to specifically investigate the incident. [20]
After visiting a number of victims two days after the incident, President Benigno Aquino III called the attack a "heinous crime", as many of the victims were "preparing for their future as productive citizens of our country." He called for the investigators to make the case their top priority, and for the perpetrator to surrender. [21] [22]
On October 3 the Fraternal Order of Utopia from Ateneo de Manila University offered a ₱200,000 (US$4,620) [23] -reward to anyone who could present information identifying the perpetrator. [24] Several anonymous donors offered an additional reward of ₱1 million (US$23,100) the next day. [23] [25] [26] Meanwhile, the Supreme Court created an eight-person investigation committee tasked with making a report by October 15. [21] [22] [24] [27]
The ID recovered from Jed Carlo Lazaga
Initial police reports considered improvised explosive devices , fireworks, Molotov cocktails , and fragmentation grenades to be possible causes of the explosion. [15] [20] Reports point to a possible cause of the incident to be a conflict between Alpha Phi Omega and Tau Gamma Phi . Armando Macaraeg, chief of the MPD Homicide Division, said that the real targets of the explosion were members of Tau Gamma Phi, and the perpetrator misfired, causing the explosive to hit Alpha Phi Beta members, who were standing nearby. [9]
MPD received from an unnamed witness, who was slightly injured by the blast, reports of a man in black jacket and white shirt bearing the emblem of Alpha Kappa Rho . This man allegedly threw the explosive from the other side of Taft Avenue, aiming for Tau Gamma Phi members; the throw fell short, hitting the San Beda students instead. [9] People went after the alleged bomber and cornered him. Identification found on the man indicated he was Jed Carlo Lazaga of University of San Jose–Recoletos in Cebu . The witness said that they were not able to surrender the man to the police, because Lazaga's companions carried guns and threatened to shoot people. Lazaga reportedly filed a mauling complaint. [28]
On September 28 the NBI had three unnamed suspects, and had identified the explosive as a Mk2 grenade . On the same day, NBI questioned Alpha Kappa Rho officials, [21] and expressed interest in summoning other fraternities that were present during the incident. [29] Alpha Kappa Rho President Jojo del Rosario acknowledged Lazaga's membership in the fraternity, and revealed that Lazaga is a fourth-year law student. He denied Lazaga's involvement in the blast, saying "why would he even complain to the police if he is guilty? He even lost his wallet, was mauled even" (trans). Del Rosario and his group presented pictures of Lazaga with at least 20 law students and professors of the university before the explosion. Lazaga was shown to be wearing a white shirt with a graphic design, contrary to the witness's claim. [30] This theory was no longer pursued when the NBI took over the MPD investigation. [31]
Identification and surrender to Binay[ edit ]
On October 19 the NBI released an artist's sketch of the suspect and several other details. The suspect was said to be a 20- to 25-year old male of medium build 5 feet 6 inches (1.68 m) to 5 feet 7 inches (1.70 m) in height and weighing 60–65 kilograms (132–143 lb). [26] The suspect was given one week to surrender. [32]
Many of those investigated are APO, including him [Nepomuceno]. We are disappointed that he is being accused but based on our interrogation and according to him, I think he is not at fault.
Anthony Leal Nepomuceno, NBI's prime suspect, surrendered to Jejomar Binay , Vice President of the Philippines and an APO member, on October 27. [32] [33] [34] [35] At the time, Nepomuceno was a 26-year old call center agent who graduated with a degree in information technology from Manuel L. Quezon University ; he was also a member of APO. Nepomuceno denied all accusations. [36] APO defended his innocence, and formed a legal team in response to the NBI complaints. [26] He said that he was inside a mall in Marikina at 5 pm buying shoes—at the same time as the bombing—and withdrew money from a bank at 7:30 pm. [37]
Binay insisted that Nepomuceno was innocent. This position was acknowledged by former Department of Justice (DOJ) Secretary Silvestre Bello III , who earlier pledged to help prosecute him if the evidence was strong. [30] [35] [38] [39] Upon the request of DOJ Secretary Leila de Lima , Binay presented Nepomuceno to the NBI on October 28. [33] [36]
I'm not saying that Nepomuceno is guilty ... the suspect can be cleared upon investigation or probable cause may be found to charge him. So, therefore, I think it would be premature for anybody to say he is innocent.
De Lima said that Nepomuceno matches the artist's sketch and the description given earlier, and the evidence against him is strong, as the NBI has at least 17 witnesses. [34] She revealed that an NBI team had earlier gone to Nepomuceno's mother in Marinduque ; his mother initially agreed to convince her son to surrender, but later refused to tell his whereabouts. [33] De Lima clarified that Nepomuceno was merely "invited for questioning and not under arrest", since no charges had been filed yet. [36] [38]
On October 28 the NBI filed to the DOJ numerous complaints of frustrated and attempted murder against Nepomuceno based on the testimonies that Nepomuceno threw the grenade. Police studied the possibility that the incident was linked to a fraternity rumble in December 2009, when Cromwell Dukha Jr. from APO was fatally stabbed, allegedly by Efraim Lim, a member of Tau Gamma Phi. Both were from San Sebastian College . Filing the complaint paved way for the start of the preliminary investigation by the DOJ. More suspects were being considered by the NBI as of the time of filing the complaints. [26]
On November 10 the DOJ identified two more APO members as suspects. Their names were not revealed. NBI believes that the two are responsible for Nepomuceno's escape during the incident. De Lima said that ongoing investigations on grenade-throwing incidents at La Consolacion College in 2008 and University of Perpetual Help System DALTA also suggest APO involvement. The two bombings left 22 and 14 wounded, respectively. [42] She noted an "apparent lack of interest" on the part of the APO leadership to cooperate in the investigation. [31] [43] [44]
On the same day, APO responded:
It disappoints us that we cannot really cooperate with Secretary De Lima because when she once said that two APO members were accomplices, they did not even identify who the two were, of the over 150,000 APO members.
—Ferdie Ramos (APO spokesperson), 
trans. from Sun.Star [45]
In a 27-page resolution signed by Prosecutor Gerardo Gaerlan and Senior Deputy State Prosecutor Richard Anthony Fadullon, DOJ found Nepomuceno's defense to be "weak", and recommended for his indictment on April 28, 2011. He was not able to prove that it was physically impossible for him to be present at the time of the bombing, and witnesses were positive that he is the person who threw the grenade. The DOJ said that Nepomuceno's submission of a photocopy of a receipt from a Metrobank ATM in Marikina does not prove his claim that he was not at Taft during the bombing, since the time on the receipt was more than two hours after the bombing. [46] [47] The resolution stated:
Considering that the scene of the crime is at Taft Avenue, Manila, which is more or less 20 kilometers away from Baranka, Marikina, then, it is not physically impossible for the respondent to be at the scene of the crime when the crime was committed, because his alibi of being in Marikina City happened only two hours after the crime was committed.
—DOJ resolution on the bombing, 
Nepomuceno submitted testimonies to support his claim, but these were dismissed by Gaerlan. He noted that these were mostly from family, friends, and fellow fraternity members. Nepomuceno accused the DOJ investigation of being "irregular and selective" for disregarding other suspects, and labeled one witnesses' statement as "ill-motivated", since the witness was from a rival fraternity. Gaerlan defended the claims as being "evidentiary in nature." [47]
He faces charges of multiple murder (for almost killing the two amputees), multiple attempted murder, [46] [47] and illegal possession of explosives. [48]
Raissa Laurel, a 23-year old law student from San Sebastian College who lost both her legs due to the event, was given an award for her "courage and strength" by People Asia on its 11th anniversary on January 10. The award was presented by President Benigno Aquino III. [49] Meanwhile, Chief Justice Renato Corona of the Supreme Court pledged to personally administer Laurel's oath-taking once she passes the bar. He promised that the Supreme Court will hire her when she recovers. [50] Nippon Foundation promised to give her prosthetic legs on her birthday on April 23, 2011. [51] She was released from the Philippine General Hospital on November 7, 2010. [52]
The 2010 Bar exam was the last to be conducted at De La Salle University. [6] [53] The 2011 exam was held in the University of Santo Tomas in November; DLSU ended its contract with the Supreme Court due to construction plans on the campus. Supreme Court spokesman Midas Marquez denied that the bombing was the reason behind the move; the move had been already planned before the blast. He also said that "necessary security measures" will be in force at UST to prevent an event similar to the 2010 bombing. [5]

Well-written:
(a) the prose is clear and concise, it respects copyright laws , and the spelling and grammar are correct;
Lead
What theory? (second paragraph)
A couple of the paragraphs (second and third especially) may need to be merged.
Incident and response
"People in the area thought that the noise from the explosion was from fireworks that are a normal part of the post-bar celebrations. A commotion followed as people panicked and ran for safety." - Wouldn't they have to realize that it was a bomb first?
Manila Doctors Hospital - does it not have an apostrophe? (i.e. not Manila Doctors' Hospital ?)
The third paragraph should probably be merged with the second, near the casualties figure.
Lazaga accused
Instead of writing (trans) after a translated quote, perhaps you should use {{ cref }}, like used in Sitti Nurbaya so that the original can be read as well, but not intrude on the text.
Indictment
"... (for almost killing the two amputees) ..." implies that they were amputees prior to the blast. Rephrasing may be in order.
(b) it complies with the manual of style guidelines for lead sections , layout , words to watch , fiction , and list incorporation .
Perhaps Lazaga accused and Identification and surrender to Binay should be standardized, as having Lazaga's name in a header but not Nepomuceno's seems POV.
Verifiable with no original research:
(a) it contains a list of all references (sources of information), presented in accordance with the layout style guideline ;
(b) all in-line citations are from reliable sources , including those for direct quotations, statistics, published opinion, counter-intuitive or controversial statements that are challenged or likely to be challenged , and contentious material relating to living persons—science-based articles should follow the scientific citation guidelines ;
Broad in its coverage:
(a) it addresses the main aspects of the topic;
Neutral : it represents viewpoints fairly and without bias, giving due weight to each.
Fine, aside from the header issue above.
Stable: it does not change significantly from day to day because of an ongoing edit war or content dispute.
Looks stable to me, most recent edits were for improvement and took place over a month ago.
Illustrated, if possible, by images :
I am worried about the FUR for both non-free images. They seem to indicate that the use is primarily for identification of the suspect, which is generally not considered a valid reason for fair use. The identification card, if produced by the government, may be Public Domain but I cannot guarantee it. The court image should probably be removed.
(b) images are relevant to the topic, and have suitable captions .
Fine.
Summary:
On hold Please address text issues per G1 and image issues per G6a. Crisco 1492 ( talk ) 08:20, 20 August 2011 (UTC)

MANILA, Philippines - The Supreme Court on Monday condemned the acts of violence by alleged warring fraternities near De La Salle University campus in Manila during Sunday’s closing of the 2010 Bar exams.
In a statement, Chief Justice Renato Corona said he has ordered the Supreme Court Security, the Manila Police District and the National Bureau of Investigation to look at all possible angles "to identify the perpetrators of this senseless act of cowardice, and bring them to the bar of justice."
"The Chief Justice sympathizes with the victims of the explosion and has directed Court Officials to attend to the victims' medical needs," he said.
The Supreme Court Public Information Office and Security Division have turned over to the investigators a video of the incident, and statements of eyewitnesses.
The High Court encouraged other witnesses to come forward and shed light on the incident for a more comprehensive investigation.
The Chief Justice has also called for a review of the security protocol, not only within the venue of the bar examinations where everything went on smoothly, but also in its periphery to prevent the occurrence of similar accidents.
Justice Conchita Carpio Morales, chairperson of the 2010 Bar Examinations, has assured everyone that the unfortunate incident will not in any way hamper or delay the checking of the examination booklets and the release of the results.  
Grenade may have caused clash
Police said a member of a fraternity may have thrown a grenade at a rival group during Sunday’s closing of the 2010 Bar exams.
At least 44 were reported hurt when a melee erupted near the De La Salle University campus in Manila, where thousands have convened for the traditional Bar operations.
In an interview with ANC, Manila Police District officer-in-charge Chief Superintendent Roberto Rongavilla said “an unofficial information (I got), there is a sketch account of a male person wearing a t-shirt with Greek letter emblem ‘AKRHO’ who then threw the suspected bomb at [the] Tau Gamma fraternity.”
Police earlier ruled out terrorism, saying a fraternity war may likely be the case behind the incident.
Rongavilla said “theoretically, we really thought it was a pillbox. On the other hand, we also thought it was a Molotov bomb. It could also be a grenade. This will be revealed later.”
He said they are now coordinating with hospital officials to confirm this theory.
“Last night, we gave instructions [to the police] to coordinate with the hospitals. That if there’s shrapnel found in the victims, it should be preserved,” he said.
The injured were brought to the Ospital ng Maynila and the Manila Adventist Hospital.
He said the police are still in the thick of threshing out the events that happened on Sunday.
A taskforce has already been created to specifically focus on the matter, called the “Task Force Bar Operations 2010.”
The taskforce intends to release the investigation results late Monday or Tuesday.

MANILA, Philippines (3rd UPDATE) – A female law student lost both her legs while another one had to have one of her legs amputated following the blast that hit the final day of the 2010 Bar exams in Manila on Sunday. 
Doctors amputated both legs of one of the victims, Raissa Laurel, because of severe injuries caused by an explosion outside the De La Salle University (DLSU) campus in Taft Avenue, Manila.
The 25-year-old Laurel, a 2nd year law student at San Sebastian College, was among the 44 people injured in a melee between alleged warring fraternities.
She is now recovering at Philippine General Hospital’s (PGH) intensive care unit.
Writing her answers to questions from ABS-CBN's Julius Babao, Laurel said that she was in the “wrong place at the wrong time.”
She, however, was thankful for being given a chance for a “second life.”
She said a bomb placed inside a small box exploded in front of her. However, she did not see who threw the bomb. 
Laurel plans to continue her studies. 
“I still want to become a lawyer someday,” she said in handwritten notes she gave to ABS-CBN News.
Her father, Roberto Laurel, was in tears while he described the pain of knowing that her daughter lost her legs.
“Another doctor, ‘yung anesthesiologist niya… approached me and explained, and he told me that my daughter would [live to] be a lawyer. So that was the happiest news last night,” he said. 
“Naaawa ako, pero she has that spirit of....definitely, one day she will become a lawyer. Iyon pong spirit na iyon, at ang kanyang ambisyon, I hope it is not totally ruined with what has happened to her,” he added. “At least she would live, but I know na yung dating… confidence, I don’t know if she could gain back that confidence.”
He urged the government to bring the perpetrators to justice.
“Gawan po natin ng aksyon ang pangyayaring ito. We are in a civilized world, and I believe that with what has happened yesterday, anarchy na po ang nangyayari eh… I appeal to the government, most especially to the Supreme Court… I’m sorry if I’m barking at the wrong tree pero sa tingin ko, sa inyo po ito, tigilan na po natin ang ganito,” Laurel said.
He thanked people who donated blood for her daughter. 
The donors include Raissa’s classmates, friends, and Private First Class (Pfc.) Arnold Delanatar and Pfc. Alfeo Jordan.
The 2 soldiers said they do not know the victim personally, and only heard word that she needed blood transfusion. They waited for 8 hours at the PGH to donate blood.
Jordan said they felt bad over what happened to the bombing victim. “Wala naman siyang kasalanan,” he added.
Delantar said Raissa thanked them by waving at them. 
Two other female law students who were also hit by the blast are still confined at the Manila Doctors’ Hospital (MDH).
One of them had to have her left leg amputated. Doctors, who declined to reveal her name, said they are still trying to save her right leg and left hand.
The 2 victims suffered shrapnel and burn wounds, doctors said. They are set to go under the knife again on Wednesday.
Twelve blast victims, who are students of San Beda College, were brought to the MDH. Seven were still receiving treatment, as of this writing. 
Supreme Court Chief Justice Renato Corona on Monday condemned the acts of violence, and ordered the Supreme Court Security, the Manila Police District (MPD), and the National Bureau of Investigation to go after those behind the incident.
Akrho tagged
MPD officer-in-charge Chief Superintendent Roberto Rongavilla said police received information that a man “wearing a t-shirt with Greek letter emblem ‘Akrho’… threw the suspected bomb at [the] Tau Gamma fraternity.”
“Meron silang na-notice, itong ating mga witnesses, na iyong suspected na naghagis ng explosive ay may nakasulat na Akrho, at based sa investigation, ang target ay ang Tau Gamma Phi, kaya lang medyo na-missed nila ang target so natapon ito sa Alpha Phi Beta ng mostly San Beda law students,” Rongavilla said.
He added that police have secured a new video footage that may help shed light on the incident.
He said police are still trying to determine the type of explosive used in the incident.
A witness told ABS-CBN News that before the explosion, he saw a group of men in the area who were covering their faces. 
When people tried to accost the group, one of the men allegedly pulled out a grenade. 
“Sumisiksik po siya sa mga tao, tapos nakita namin na meron po siyang dinukot sa bag niya na Granada, tapos hinugot, tapos ginanon niya po niya sa ilalim. Pagkababa niya po, bigla na pong sumabog,” said the witness.
People went after the alleged bomber and cornered him. 
An ID found on the man showed his name as Jed Carlo Lazaga of the University of San Jose Recoletos in Cebu.  
He was reportedly wearing a jacket bearing the insignia of the Akrho fraternity.
The witness said they were not able to surrender the man to police because the suspects’ companions had a gun and threatened to shoot people. 
Lazaga has reportedly approached police to file a mauling complaint. 
“Inatasan ko nga ang hepe ng Station 9 to exhaust all available means na ma-invite nila ‘yung tao and makapagbigay-liwanag sa nasabing insidente,” MPD District 2 head Superintendent Ernesto Fojas said.
Fraternity head denies involvement
Alpha Kappa Rho fraternity national council president Jojo de Rosario, meanwhile, denied allegations that one of their members was behind the blast. 
He said Lazaga is not a member of their fraternity.
He added that Akrho officials would immediately know if their members are involved in the incident. 
“We’re trying to professionalize the organization. Walang aggression na mag-start sa amin,” del Rosario said.
He said he was in the area during the incident to support Beta Sigma Lambda fraternity members, who were having their exams. 
Del Rosario said he was crossing Taft Avenue when he heard an explosion. 
“Biglang may sumigaw na babae, na sabi niya, ‘harangin niyo ‘yun, harangin nyo.’ Ang nakita ko, dumaan sa akin, tumatakbo,” he said. 
He claimed that he tried to block the unidentified man, whose face was covered with a large handkerchief.
 

2010 Badakhshan massacre - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia 2010 Badakhshan massacre. From Wikipedia, the free ... Nuristan Eye Camp team were killed in Kuran wa Munjan District of Badakhshan Province in Afghanistan. ... Unknown
On 5 August 2010, ten members of International Assistance Mission (IAM) Nuristan Eye Camp team were killed in Kuran wa Munjan District of Badakhshan Province in Afghanistan. [1] [2] The team was attacked as it was returning from Nuristan to Kabul. One team member was spared, the rest of the team were killed immediately. Those killed were six Americans, two Afghans, one Briton and one German. [3]
The identity of the attackers is unknown. When news of the killings broke, both Hizb-e Islami and the Taliban initially claimed responsibility for the attack, [2] accusing the doctors of proselytism and spying. [4] [5] [6] These claims were later refuted by Taliban leaders in Nuristan and Badakhshan, who stated that they had confirmed the dead were bona-fide aid workers, condemned the killings as murder, and offered their condolences to the families of those killed. [7]
The attack was the deadliest strike against foreign aid workers in the Afghanistan war . [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The killings underscored the suspicion Christian-affiliated groups face from some Afghans and government opponents and the wider risks faced by aid workers in the country. [13]

Background and context[ edit ]
Badakhshan province borders Tajikistan and is inhabited by mostly Tajik people . It is one of the few provinces in Afghanistan which was not controlled by the Taliban when it was in power. [14] After coming under increasing pressure by NATO forces in southern Afghanistan the Taliban have become active in areas like Badakhshan Province which were previously calm. In addition they have started using women and children as suicide bombers and targeted tribal elders, things they formerly considered taboo. [2] Foreign aid workers have been attacked in the past but these attacks have been relatively infrequent and Taliban has allowed some aid workers in the areas they controlled. [9] Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission stated that civilian deaths were up five percent in 2010 and Taliban was responsible for 68% of the 1325 deaths till 8 August 2010 and NATO was responsible for 28%. [15] IAM is a Christian organization that has worked in Afghanistan since 1966. They have denied proselytizing , [16] as for non-Muslims it is against the law of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. According to critics propagandists of the Taliban insurgency portray their drive for power as a defense of Islam. The victims of the massacre had indeed been sponsored by a Christian charity, but that organization worked in Afghanistan since 1966, under a monarchy, a communist regime, warlords, and under the Taliban; its aid workers were said to understand the Afghan customs and sensibilities and have scrupulously obeyed prohibitions against proselytizing. [17] None of the Christian non-profit's workers had ever been killed while on duty with the organisation. [18]
The publicity on the massacre and its aftermath coincided with the publication of the 2010 Mid-Year Report on Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), [19] [20] [21] in which worries were expressed about the rising number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan and that was directly followed by an advice of human rights organisation Amnesty International that the Taliban should be prosecuted for war crimes . [22] According to the UNAMA report, the tactics of the Taliban and other Anti-Government Elements (AGEs) were behind a 31 per cent increase in conflict-related civilian casualties in the first six months of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Casualties attributed to Pro-Government Forces (PGF) fell 30 per cent during the same period, driven by a 64 per cent decline in deaths and injuries caused by aerial attacks. Many Afghans blame the international forces for the civilian deaths, "stirring up greater violence by fomenting new recruits for the Taliban, for arming militias in the countryside, and for propping up warlords and corrupt Afghan officials". [23] [24] [25]
The team, which included a doctor, a dentist and an optometrist, was returning to Kabul after providing eye care to villagers in Parun valley in Nuristan Province , south of Badakhshan Province in Northeast Afghanistan. [11] They had been running an eye camp in Nuristan, for which they had received permission from the Afghan government. They had chosen to travel through a forest in Badakhshan as this was considered a safer route back to Kabul. The team was attacked when they stopped after fording a river. They were killed immediately, without any negotiation. One Afghan driver was spared after he started chanting verses from the Qur'an . [2] When the bodies were recovered, the victims appeared to have been robbed. [14] The two Afghans killed worked as a watchman and a cook. The bodies of the victims were flown back to Kabul on 8 August 2010. [15] The foreigners killed were all unpaid volunteers. [14]
Mahram Ali, aged 51 years, [27] of the Hazara ethnic minority, from Wardak , Afghanistan, was a civilian contractor that had been a worker at the National Organisation for Ophthalmic Rehabilitation ’s (NOOR's) maintenance workshop since 2007; [28] he served as a driver for the expedition, and as "watcher", to guard team vehicles. [28] [29] In this service to IAM , Ali drove and “stayed behind guarding the vehicles in Nawa when the rest of the team walked over the pass into Nuristan.” [28] Ali was described as "the only person to care for his family” by Rahim Majid, the operations manager at IAM. [29] Ali was also survived by a wife and three young children, [28] [29] including one son paralyzed by polio and an another son whose arm had been amputated, all supported on his monthly $150 salary.

Daniela Beyer, aged 35 years, [27] was a linguist and translator in German, English and Russian who also spoke Dari and was learning Pashto; from Chemnitz-Wittgensdorf , Germany. [32] [33]
Brian Carderelli, aged 25 years and from Harrisonburg, Virginia , United States, [27] was a civilian contractor, and a professional freelance videographer who had worked with various Afghan development and humanitarian organizations in Afghanistan. [34] [35] [36] Carderelli had been working for the International School of Kabul , and documenting aid work done by the IAM and other groups. [35] A statement released by his family said that Calderelli "loved people and was particularly concerned for the poor". [35] [36] He was a lifelong member of Covenant Presbyterian Church in Harrisonburg, [35] and a 2009 graduate of James Madison University and was approaching the one year anniversary of his service in Afghanistan. [35] [36] According to his family, “Brian quickly fell in love with the Afghan people and culture and hoped to stay within the country for another year,” [35] and was compiling a photographic and video album entitled "The Beauty – It's Not All War." [35] [36]
Thomas Grams, aged 51 years, [27] of Durango, Colorado , United States, friend of team leader Tom Little, began to work in dentistry for impoverished children about 10 years before his death, via Denver -based agency Global Dental Relief (GDR). [27] [37] One of native twin brothers and dentists from Park Rapids, Minnesota, [38] Grams left their "thriving" private general dentistry practice in Durango in 2007 to join GDR full-time, [27] [37] [39] [40] going first to Nepal ("trekk[ing]... halfway up... Everest, carrying dental equipment by yak" [27] ), [37] and then several times to Afghanistan, initially as a volunteer, later as team leader. [37] [38] [40] Significant Afghanistan efforts included providing free dental care in the village Wardak, "negotiat[ing] the etiquette of the burka" to found a Kabul dental clinic (employing a local female dentist), [27] [39] and participating in English teaching at a local school. [39] "[U]nassuming and modest," Grams was described by the IAM as "one of our favorit[e]" aid workers. [37]
Jawed, known by this single name, aged 24 years, [27] from Panjshir , Afghanistan, was a civilian contractor that had been at the Eye Hospital of the Afghan Ministry of Public Health in Kabul, and was given leave to serve as the team cook at its Eye Camp. [41] This was not his first service with IAM , where he cooked and helped with dispensing eyeglasses; per the IAM, “Jawed had been on several eye camps into Nuristan in the past, and was well loved for his sense of humor,” [41] and was known for providing his collection of music tapes for weddings and parties. [27] The principal breadwinner for his wife, three young children, and extended family, [27] [41] Jawed had been excited about the $20-a-day in overtime that he was earning on the medical outreach trip. [27] Jawed’s brother Abdul Bagin described his killers as "infidels; not human, not Muslims... [killing] without any judgment, without any trial”. [27]
Glen D. Lapp[ edit ]
Glen D. Lapp, aged 40 years, [27] was a nurse and executive assistant from Lancaster, Pennsylvania , United States, and a part of Community Mennonite Church of Lancaster. [42] Lapp was a medical volunteer with the IAM and its partner, the Mennonite Central Committee (MCC). [42] He was serving as manager of IAM 's provincial Ophthalmology program, and as an executive assistant for IAM in Afghanistan, [42] and had been in Afghanistan for two years. [43] Lapp was an alumnus of Eastern Mennonite and Johns Hopkins Universities, and had assisted the MCC in the weeks following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita , with regular prior nursing work Lancaster, Supai, Arizona , and New York City. [42]
Tom Little, aged 61 years, [27] was an optometrist from Delmar, New York , United States, and leader of the IAM team. Little had worked in Afghanistan for more than three decades, having arrived in the late 1970s; [44] he had raised three daughters there,[ citation needed ] and spoke Dari fluently. [44] Little was posthumously recognized as International Optometrist of the Year by the World Council of Optometry , [45] and the 2010 Presidential Medal of Freedom . [46]
Dan Terry, aged 64 years, [27] was from Wisconsin, United States, who served as liaison with local communities, aid organizations, and the government; he had performed relief work in Afghanistan since 1971, following in his father's footsteps who had worked for IAM as the Executive Director. [47] [48]
Karen Woo, aged 36 years, [27] daughter of a Chinese father and English mother, [49] was a general surgeon from Stevenage , Hertfordshire, UK, [3] [37] [50] trained at St Mary's Hospital, London and formerly with the English healthcare organisation Bupa . [51] Woo's work involved helping pregnant women, in an area with a high global infant mortality rate. [50] After her death, Woo's family stated that "although very spiritual, she did not really believe in organised religion" and that her motivations were purely humanitarian. [52] [53] Woo was engaged to be married at the time of her death. [2] [50]
The only two survivors of the eye camp team were Said Yasin and Safiullah, both Afghan. Said Yasin had left the team several days earlier and returned to Kabul by another route, [26] whereas Safiullah was spared after reciting verses from the Koran. [54]
The local officials initially stated that the motive was robbery, but after interviewing witnesses they changed their view and said that Taliban was responsible. [2] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahaden claimed responsibility for the attacks and accused the victims of being "American spies" and "proselytizing Christianity". [14] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid stated that the victims had in their possession Bibles which had been translated into the local language Dari . [55] However, also another group was mentioned, the Hizb-i-Islami (HIA) of warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] Earlier claims of the Taliban were refuted by Qari Malang, the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban. He said that commanders from Nuristan had not carried out the killings and they had launched an investigation to find out who had. "We shall inform you of the results when it is concluded. We regret these killings and strongly assert that this is not the work of the Taliban who will never do harm to genuine aid workers… as soon as we manage to apprehend those responsible for this act, we shall subject them to whatever punishment our laws prescribe." [7] Dirk Frans, executive director of the IAM in Kabul, doubted whether the local Taliban were behind the attack, [61] in contrast to a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton which directly blamed the Taliban for what she described as a "despicable act of wanton violence.". In her reaction on 8 August 2010, she stated: "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this senseless act. We also condemn the Taliban’s transparent attempt to justify the unjustifiable by making false accusations about their activities in Afghanistan. Terror has no religion (...), they have shown us yet another example of the lengths to which they will go to advance their twisted ideology." [62] [63]
In the weeks following the attack a senior Taliban leader, Qari Malang (the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban) stated "We have checked the facts regarding these foreigners, and our people in the area have conﬁrmed that they were bona ﬁde aid workers and had been providing assistance to the population. Furthermore, we have learnt that among the killed foreigners, was Dan Terry, who had a long history of helping our people, including in Kunar and Laghman provinces and that he had previously provided welfare assistance to the families of those civilians martyred in bombardments… We pass on our condolences to the families of those killed." [7]
After the massacre, the IAM stated that they had no plans to leave Afghanistan. [64] US Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into the attacks according a spokesman from US embassy. [64] [65]
Former Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah who is a physician himself and trained with Tom Little deplored the killings and called the attackers "enemies of the Afghan people." [66]
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who emphasized that "health workers must have access to treat those in need and must be able to do so without fear." [67] His Special Representative Staffan de Mistura said "The United Nations condemns this serious crime and apparent cold-blooded execution." [68]
Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith issued a statement condemning the attack and offered condolences to the victims' families. [69] British foreign secretary William Hague condemned the attack and stated "This is a deplorable and cowardly act which is against the interests of the people of Afghanistan who depended on the services she [Karen Woo] was bravely helping to provide." [9] United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton condemned the killings, calling them "despicable acts of wanton violence." (see above) [15] Karl Eikenberry , the current United States Ambassador to Afghanistan , speaking to Afghan people said, "Their murder demonstrates the absolute disregard that terrorist-inspired Taliban and other insurgents have for your health, have for your security and have for your opportunity, They don't care about your future. They only care about themselves and their own ideology." [37] US special envoy Richard Holbrooke stated the killers do not represent average Afghans, most of whom were shocked by these killings. [69]

Should this be called a 'massacre'? I agree it was dreadful, but NPOV applies: if ten Afghanis had been killed, would it have been called a 'massacre'? Aa42john ( talk ) —Preceding undated comment added 13:29, 8 August 2010 (UTC).
Came here solely to point that out. Should be renamed to "2010 Badakhshan incident". It's not necessarily a POV to claim it was a massacre, however; I believe there is a threshold for what is deemed what. Eric

Some of the RS are calling it a 'massacre'. [1] and yes if 10 afghan , unarmed civilian aid workers had been lined up and shot in cold blood it should be called a massacre. 2 of the victims were Afghan. any thresholds anybody has would necessarily be arbitrary.see Munich massacre for example and precedent.-- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 14:34, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
I also find "massacre" to be rather provocatively POV, as well as inaccurate and support changing the title to "2010 Badakhshan incident". Doc Tropics 17:11, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
I feel that "massacre" is the correct terminology in this instance. Massacre is defined in the Oxford English Dictionary as "the indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people", which seems to accurately describe what took place, regardless of political perspective. The problem with "incident" is that the term implies a relative insignificant occurrence, and could be perceived as minimising the importance of what took place. City of Destruction 18:01, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
NATO kills civilians accidently not on purpose, but these guys killed on purpose.. And you are accually POV. NATO is not there to kill civilians.. Is it difficult to understand? In which world do you live? But I understand you because your holy book Quran says :"Muslims and Christians can not be friend." —Preceding unsigned comment added by 217.131.183.218 ( talk ) 19:40, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
Doesnt seem to be indiscriminate ("2.Random; haphazard") if the Taliban explicitly said why it was a target. Why not call the Iraq and Afghan wars massacres then? Lihaas ( talk ) 20:31, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
does look haphazard/ indiscriminate. why kill 2 Afghans if motive was to kill proselytizing Christians. Besides New York Times [2] describes it as a massacre.-- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 21:22, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
Well you're asking the Taliban to be logical by demanding why they killed two of their own in addition to killing 8 Christians; the fact that they're justifying 9/11, attempting to kill or maim fleeing women ( http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/worldnews/article-1299799/Mutilated-Taliban-The-girl-18-nose-ears-hacked-trying-flee-cruel-laws.html ) and so forth means we can expect at least a little illogic on their part. But just a little! Furthermore, it's been made very explicit by the Taliban, such as this recent release: ( http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2010/07/mullah_omar_orders_t.php ) that the Taliban consider any collaborating Afghani to be a traitor. And Islam demands the death of Apostates (Qur'an (4:89)) (Qur'an (9:11-12)) So to answer all of your politically correct attempts to cover up the Islamic and discriminatory nature of the attack, here is my final piece of evidence:
Zabihullah Mujahid, a Taliban spokesman, said bibles translated into Dari had been found. "Yesterday at around 0800 (0330 GMT), one of our patrols confronted a group of foreigners. They were Christian missionaries and we killed them all," he told the AFP news agency.

68.42.250.113 ( talk ) 22:20, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
And on another point, the Iraq war and the Afghan wars are not called massacres, because equating the military performance of the US (where at least soldiers have orders not to harm civilians as the rules of war dictate) with the performance of the Taliban, who as I have already shown above, are not above killing women for fleeing their husbands or offering medical aid is ridiculous. 68.42.250.113 ( talk ) 22:38, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
If you want to use that logic, then i suppose raping and killing girls (that doesnt include women, or even premeditated murder of men) is the mandate of the usa govt/military too as per the Rules of war ? Lihaas ( talk ) 22:45, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
No because those aren't the actions of US soldiers or by any within the rules of war. You're not referring to any logic I have used there buddy. The US army does not rape anyone. It also has orders not to kill civilians. A massacre and a war are two different things, that was the only logic implied. 68.42.250.113 ( talk ) 00:52, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
A specific mass killing of civilians by US forces, such as the My Lai Massacre , can be described as a massacre. A conflict in which the US is involved, including Vietnam and Afghanistan, cannot. City of Destruction 15:55, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
Because one of them is a war, and the other is a specific event in war that is against the rules of war. 68.42.250.113 ( talk ) 16:32, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
She is becoming the focus of separate and extensive attention. I think based on other articles, she should get her own page. Proven81 ( talk ) 15:44, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
I agree.-- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 16:31, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
She is getting far, far more coverage than anyone else. Maybe it's her looks. Paris Hilton gets far more coverage than her acting career would suggest and Anna Chapman got far more coverage than the other Russian spies. Suomi Finland 2009 ( talk ) 18:43, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
or maybe the fact she is a young woman surgeon who gave up a lucrative career to work for the poor in a dangerous country and was to marry in 2 weeks. regardless of the reason she is getting a lot of coverage in the RS's and would merit her own article.-- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 21:26, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
An admirable person certainly. Not so sure she is notable enough for her own article. At least a re-direct from Karen Woo to this article seems a good idea. (Done I see! & Tom Little ) Same for the other named persons involved too? Glen D. Lapp , Thomas Grams ? 220.101 talk \Contribs 03:49, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
Should every piece of news really be turned into an encyclopedia article? The word massacre as was stated before: "the indiscriminate and brutal slaughter of people." It wasn't indiscriminate from the accounts of what happened that appear in the news. FYI: indiscriminate: Done at random or without careful judgment
The reaction section is just there for emotional effect. Remember to include reaction statements from the belligerents. Unless you enjoy bias.
—Preceding unsigned comment added by 76.113.192.38 ( talk ) 18:45, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
Ditto, and Said the same above.
Also need a "responsibility" section for why Talib did so and their claim thereof,. Lihaas ( talk ) 20:34, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
The statement from Taliban spokesman was part of the article from the beginning. i doubt very much that we will get many statements sympathetic to the Taliban here. but if we do they should be included as long as they come from prominent sources. -- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 21:37, 8 August 2010 (UTC)
If he does not get his own page (along with each of the victims) should this link to pictures of one of his eye camps be added to the end? http://globalphotographer.wordpress.com/afghanistan/afghanistan-2004/noor-eye-project/ Proepro ( talk ) —Preceding undated comment added 12:47, 9 August 2010 (UTC).
Be bold! 220.101 talk \Contribs 20:01, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
Info on all 10 killed:
the "Victoms" section and documentation of each victim is completely memorialising and does not further this article. The list at the top of the 10 victims is brief and notable to this, but the lifestory of some such as "engaged to be married in two weeks" is complete nonsense for an encyclopaedia Lihaas ( talk ) 23:39, 9 August 2010 (UTC)
nothing is nonsense here. People reading about this incident would be interested in some detail about the victims and this info is very useful. especially so if we are not going to have separate articles for the victim especially Woo. The RS's are replete with details of her life. if we do end up having separate articles for the victims then maybe we can move some info there. Till then we need to add further detail about the victims and expand the section. this is all very encyclopedic info which definitely belongs.-- Wikireader41 ( talk ) 00:21, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
Lets just keep in mind Encyclopaedia , RECENTISM and NOTNEWS . The article looks alright. After the furor dies down, investigations are made and the facts (hopefully) come out, then culling of some details may be in order, IMHO. Regards, 220.101 talk \Contribs 03:00, 10 August 2010 (UTC)
This article or section is written like a memorial. Please help rewrite it from a neutral point of view to establish the notability of the subject.
NPOV? Are you kidding me? From who's point of view? The benefiting Grim Reaper or the Taliban's? 68.42.250.113 ( talk ) 17:59, 11 August 2010 (UTC)
Update of the killing[ edit ]
[Hamid Karzai] statement?[ edit ]
Does anyone have a statement from Karzai about this? Proepro ( talk ) 17:03, 21 August 2010 (UTC)

2010 Badakhshan massacre - WOW.com Search the Web. Search ... Unknown
On 5 August 2010, ten members of International Assistance Mission (IAM) Nuristan Eye Camp team were killed in Kuran wa Munjan District of Badakhshan Province in Afghanistan. [1] [2] The team was attacked as it was returning from Nuristan to Kabul. One team member was spared, the rest of the team were killed immediately. Those killed were six Americans, two Afghans, one Briton and one German. [3]
The identity of the attackers is unknown. When news of the killings broke, both Hizb-e Islami and the Taliban initially claimed responsibility for the attack, [2] accusing the doctors of proselytism and spying. [4] [5] [6] These claims were later refuted by Taliban leaders in Nuristan and Badakhshan, who stated that they had confirmed the dead were bona-fide aid workers, condemned the killings as murder, and offered their condolences to the families of those killed. [7]
The attack was the deadliest strike against foreign aid workers in the Afghanistan war . [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The killings underscored the suspicion Christian-affiliated groups face from some Afghans and government opponents and the wider risks faced by aid workers in the country. [13]
Contents
Background and context
Badakhshan province borders Tajikistan and is inhabited by mostly Tajik people . It is one of the few provinces in Afghanistan which was not controlled by the Taliban when it was in power. [14] After coming under increasing pressure by NATO forces in southern Afghanistan the Taliban have become active in areas like Badakhshan Province which were previously calm. In addition they have started using women and children as suicide bombers and targeted tribal elders, things they formerly considered taboo. [2] Foreign aid workers have been attacked in the past but these attacks have been relatively infrequent and Taliban has allowed some aid workers in the areas they controlled. [9] Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission stated that civilian deaths were up five percent in 2010 and Taliban was responsible for 68% of the 1325 deaths till 8 August 2010 and NATO was responsible for 28%. [15] IAM is a Christian organization that has worked in Afghanistan since 1966. They have denied proselytizing , [16] as for non-Muslims it is against the law of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. According to critics propagandists of the Taliban insurgency portray their drive for power as a defense of Islam. The victims of the massacre had indeed been sponsored by a Christian charity, but that organization worked in Afghanistan since 1966, under a monarchy, a communist regime, warlords, and under the Taliban; its aid workers were said to understand the Afghan customs and sensibilities and have scrupulously obeyed prohibitions against proselytizing. [17] None of the Christian non-profit's workers had ever been killed while on duty with the organisation. [18]
The publicity on the massacre and its aftermath coincided with the publication of the 2010 Mid-Year Report on Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), [19] [20] [21] in which worries were expressed about the rising number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan and that was directly followed by an advice of human rights organisation Amnesty International that the Taliban should be prosecuted for war crimes . [22] According to the UNAMA report, the tactics of the Taliban and other Anti-Government Elements (AGEs) were behind a 31 per cent increase in conflict-related civilian casualties in the first six months of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Casualties attributed to Pro-Government Forces (PGF) fell 30 per cent during the same period, driven by a 64 per cent decline in deaths and injuries caused by aerial attacks. Many Afghans blame the international forces for the civilian deaths, "stirring up greater violence by fomenting new recruits for the Taliban, for arming militias in the countryside, and for propping up warlords and corrupt Afghan officials". [23] [24] [25]
Ambush
The team, which included a doctor, a dentist and an optometrist, was returning to Kabul after providing eye care to villagers in Parun valley in Nuristan Province , south of Badakhshan Province in Northeast Afghanistan. [11] They had been running an eye camp in Nuristan, for which they had received permission from the Afghan government. They had chosen to travel through a forest in Badakhshan as this was considered a safer route back to Kabul. The team was attacked when they stopped after fording a river. They were killed immediately, without any negotiation. One Afghan driver was spared after he started chanting verses from the Qur'an . [2] When the bodies were recovered, the victims appeared to have been robbed. [14] The two Afghans killed worked as a watchman and a cook. The bodies of the victims were flown back to Kabul on 8 August 2010. [15] The foreigners killed were all unpaid volunteers. [14]

[28] [29] In this service to IAM , Ali drove and “stayed behind guarding the vehicles in Nawa when the rest of the team walked over the pass into Nuristan.” [28] Ali was described as "the only person to care for his family” by Rahim Majid, the operations manager at IAM. [29] Ali was also survived by a wife and three young children, [28] [29] including one son paralyzed by polio and an another son whose arm had been amputated, all supported on his monthly $150 salary.

Everest, carrying dental equipment by yak" [27] ), [37] and then several times to Afghanistan, initially as a volunteer, later as team leader. [37] [38] [40] Significant Afghanistan efforts included providing free dental care in the village Wardak, "negotiat[ing] the etiquette of the burka" to found a Kabul dental clinic (employing a local female dentist), [27] [39] and participating in English teaching at a local school. [39] "[U]nassuming and modest," Grams was described by the IAM as "one of our favorit[e]" aid workers. [37]

[41] This was not his first service with IAM , where he cooked and helped with dispensing eyeglasses; per the IAM, “Jawed had been on several eye camps into Nuristan in the past, and was well loved for his sense of humor,” [41] and was known for providing his collection of music tapes for weddings and parties. [27] The principal breadwinner for his wife, three young children, and extended family, [27] [41] Jawed had been excited about the $20-a-day in overtime that he was earning on the medical outreach trip. [27] Jawed’s brother Abdul Bagin described his killers as "infidels; not human, not Muslims... [killing] without any judgment, without any trial”. [27]

[51] Woo's work involved helping pregnant women, in an area with a high global infant mortality rate. [50] After her death, Woo's family stated that "although very spiritual, she did not really believe in organised religion" and that her motivations were purely humanitarian. [52] [53] Woo was engaged to be married at the time of her death. [2] [50]
Survivors
The only two survivors of the eye camp team were Said Yasin and Safiullah, both Afghan. Said Yasin had left the team several days earlier and returned to Kabul by another route, [26] whereas Safiullah was spared after reciting verses from the Koran. [54]
Responsibility
The local officials initially stated that the motive was robbery, but after interviewing witnesses they changed their view and said that Taliban was responsible. [2] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahaden claimed responsibility for the attacks and accused the victims of being "American spies" and "proselytizing Christianity". [14] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid stated that the victims had in their possession Bibles which had been translated into the local language Dari . [55] However, also another group was mentioned, the Hizb-i-Islami (HIA) of warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] Earlier claims of the Taliban were refuted by Qari Malang, the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban. He said that commanders from Nuristan had not carried out the killings and they had launched an investigation to find out who had. "We shall inform you of the results when it is concluded. We regret these killings and strongly assert that this is not the work of the Taliban who will never do harm to genuine aid workers… as soon as we manage to apprehend those responsible for this act, we shall subject them to whatever punishment our laws prescribe." [7] Dirk Frans, executive director of the IAM in Kabul, doubted whether the local Taliban were behind the attack, [61] in contrast to a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton which directly blamed the Taliban for what she described as a "despicable act of wanton violence.". In her reaction on 8 August 2010, she stated: "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this senseless act. We also condemn the Taliban’s transparent attempt to justify the unjustifiable by making false accusations about their activities in Afghanistan. Terror has no religion (...), they have shown us yet another example of the lengths to which they will go to advance their twisted ideology." [62] [63]
Reactions
In the weeks following the attack a senior Taliban leader, Qari Malang (the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban) stated "We have checked the facts regarding these foreigners, and our people in the area have conﬁrmed that they were bona ﬁde aid workers and had been providing assistance to the population. Furthermore, we have learnt that among the killed foreigners, was Dan Terry, who had a long history of helping our people, including in Kunar and Laghman provinces and that he had previously provided welfare assistance to the families of those civilians martyred in bombardments… We pass on our condolences to the families of those killed." [7]
After the massacre, the IAM stated that they had no plans to leave Afghanistan. [64] US Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into the attacks according a spokesman from US embassy. [64] [65]
Former Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah who is a physician himself and trained with Tom Little deplored the killings and called the attackers "enemies of the Afghan people." [66]
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who emphasized that "health workers must have access to treat those in need and must be able to do so without fear." [67] His Special Representative Staffan de Mistura said "The United Nations condemns this serious crime and apparent cold-blooded execution." [68]
Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith issued a statement condemning the attack and offered condolences to the victims' families. [69] British foreign secretary William Hague condemned the attack and stated "This is a deplorable and cowardly act which is against the interests of the people of Afghanistan who depended on the services she [Karen Woo] was bravely helping to provide." [9] United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton condemned the killings, calling them "despicable acts of wanton violence." (see above) [15] Karl Eikenberry , the current United States Ambassador to Afghanistan , speaking to Afghan people said, "Their murder demonstrates the absolute disregard that terrorist-inspired Taliban and other insurgents have for your health, have for your security and have for your opportunity, They don't care about your future. They only care about themselves and their own ideology." [37] US special envoy Richard Holbrooke stated the killers do not represent average Afghans, most of whom were shocked by these killings. [69]

On August 5, 2010, ten members of International Assistance Mission Nuristan Eye Camp team were killed in Kuran wa Munjan District of Badakhshan Province in Afghanistan . [1] [2] The team was attacked as it was returning from Nuristan to Kabul. One team member was spared, the rest of the team were killed immediately. Those killed were six Americans, two Afghans, one Briton and one German. [3]
The identity of the attackers is unknown. When news of the killings broke, both Hizb-e Islami and the Taliban initially claimed responsibility for the attack, [2] accusing the doctors of proselytism and spying. [4] [5] [6] These claims were later refuted by Taliban leaders in Nuristan and Badakhshan, who stated that they had confirmed the dead were bona-fide aid workers, condemned the killings as murder, and offered their condolences to the families of those killed. [7]
The attack was the deadliest strike against foreign aid workers in the Afghanistan war . [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] The killings underscored the suspicion Christian-affiliated groups face from some Afghans and government opponents and the wider risks faced by aid workers in the country. [13]
Contents
Badakhshan province borders Tajikistan and is inhabited by mostly Tajik people . It is one of the few provinces in Afghanistan which was not controlled by the Taliban when it was in power. [14] After coming under increasing pressure by NATO forces in southern Afghanistan the Taliban have become active in areas like Badakhshan Province which were previously calm. In addition they have started using women and children as suicide bombers and targeted tribal elders, things they formerly considered taboo. [2] Foreign aid workers have been attacked in the past but these attacks have been relatively infrequent and Taliban has allowed some aid workers in the areas they controlled. [9] Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission stated that civilian deaths were up five percent in 2010 and Taliban was responsible for 68% of the 1325 deaths till August 8, 2010 and NATO was responsible for 28%. [15] International Assistance Mission is a Christian organization that has worked in Afghanistan since 1966. They have denied proselytizing , [16] as for non-Muslims it is against the law of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan. According to critics propagandists of the Taliban insurgency portray their drive for power as a defense of Islam. The victims of the massacre had indeed been sponsored by a Christian charity, but that organization worked in Afghanistan since 1966, under a monarchy, a communist regime, warlords, and under the Taliban; its aid workers were said to understand the Afghan customs and sensibilities and have scrupulously obeyed prohibitions against proselytizing. [17] None of the Christian non-profit's workers had ever been killed while on duty with the organisation. [18]
The publicity on the massacre and its aftermath coincided with the publication of the 2010 Mid-Year Report on Protection of Civilians in Armed Conflict of the United Nations Assistance Mission in Afghanistan (UNAMA), [19] [20] [21] in which worries were expressed about the rising number of civilian casualties in Afghanistan and that was directly followed by an advice of human rights organisation Amnesty International that the Taliban should be prosecuted for war crimes . [22] According to the UNAMA report, the tactics of the Taliban and other Anti-Government Elements (AGEs) were behind a 31 per cent increase in conflict-related civilian casualties in the first six months of 2010 compared with the same period in 2009. Casualties attributed to Pro-Government Forces (PGF) fell 30 per cent during the same period, driven by a 64 per cent decline in deaths and injuries caused by aerial attacks. Many Afghans blame the international forces for the civilian deaths, "stirring up greater violence by fomenting new recruits for the Taliban, for arming militias in the countryside, and for propping up warlords and corrupt Afghan officials". [23] [24] [25]
Ambush
The team, which included a doctor, a dentist and an optometrist, was returning to Kabul after providing eye care to villagers in Parun valley in Nuristan Province , south of Badakhshan Province in Northeast Afghanistan. [11] They had been running an eye camp in Nuristan, for which they had received permission from the Afghan government. They had chosen to travel through a forest in Badakhshan as this was considered a safer route back to Kabul. The team was attacked when they stopped after fording a river. They were killed immediately, without any negotiation. One Afghan driver was spared after he started chanting verses from the Qur'an. [2] When the bodies were recovered, the victims appeared to have been robbed. [14] The two Afghans killed worked as a watchman and a cook. The bodies of the victims were flown back to Kabul on August 8, 2010. [15] The foreigners killed were all unpaid volunteers. [14]

[37] (The International Assistance Mission is a partner with the Mennonite Central Committee.) Lapp had worked for the IAM in Afghanistan for two years. [38] An alumnus of Johns Hopkins University and Eastern Mennonite University , Lapp had previously worked as a nurse in New York City , Lancaster, Pennsylvania and Supai, Arizona . [37] Additionally, Lapp assisted the MCC in the weeks following Hurricanes Katrina and Rita . [37] Lapp also worked as a realtor and attended the Community Mennonite Church of Lancaster, where news of his death was first announced on August 8, 2010. [37]

Tom Little (62) was an optometrist from Delmar, New York , United States, and the team leader.
He had worked in Afghanistan for more than three decades and spoke Dari fluently. [39] He moved to Afghanistan in the late seventies and raised his three daughters there.

[43] By her late teens, she had become a professional dancer and subsequently performed stunts as a wing-walker for a flying circus. After returning to university, she became a surgeon and trained at St Mary's Hospital, London . She left a lucrative position with Bupa (a healthcare organisation) in England to work with the poor people of Afghanistan. [44] Woo was engaged to be married in two weeks. [2] Afghanistan has one of the highest infant mortality rates in the world and her work involved helping pregnant women. [42] Her family stated that Woo "although very spiritual, she did not really believe in organised religion" and that her motivations were purely humanitarian. [45] [46]
Survivors
The only two survivors of the eye camp team were Said Yasin and Safiullah, both Afghan. Said Yasin had left the team several days earlier and returned to Kabul by another route, [26] whereas Safiullah was spared after reciting verses from the Koran. [47]
Responsibility
The local officials initially stated that the motive was robbery, but after interviewing witnesses they changed their view and said that Taliban was responsible. [2] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahaden claimed responsibility for the attacks and accused the victims of being "American spies" and "proselytizing Christianity". [14] Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid stated that the victims had in their possession Bibles which had been translated into the local language Dari . [48] However, also another group was mentioned, the Hizb-i-Islami (HIA) of warlord Gulbuddin Hekmatyar . [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] Earlier claims of the Taliban were refuted by Qari Malang, the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban. He said that commanders from Nuristan had not carried out the killings and they had launched an investigation to find out who had. “We shall inform you of the results when it is concluded. We regret these killings and strongly assert that this is not the work of the Taliban who will never do harm to genuine aid workers… as soon as we manage to apprehend those responsible for this act, we shall subject them to whatever punishment our laws prescribe.” [7] Dirk Frans, executive director of the International Assistance Mission (IAM) in Kabul, doubted whether the local Taliban were behind the attack, [54] in contrast to a statement by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton which directly blamed the Taliban for what she described as a "despicable act of wanton violence.". In her reaction on August 8, 2010, she stated: "We condemn in the strongest possible terms this senseless act. We also condemn the Taliban’s transparent attempt to justify the unjustifiable by making false accusations about their activities in Afghanistan. Terror has no religion (...), they have shown us yet another example of the lengths to which they will go to advance their twisted ideology." [55] [56]
Reactions
In the weeks following the attack a senior Taliban leader, Qari Malang (the representative of the Western Nuristan Taliban) stated “We have checked the facts regarding these foreigners, and our people in the area have conﬁrmed that they were bona ﬁde aid workers and had been providing assistance to the population. Furthermore, we have learnt that among the killed foreigners, was Dan Terry, who had a long history of helping our people, including in Kunar and Laghman provinces and that he had previously provided welfare assistance to the families of those civilians martyred in bombardments… We pass on our condolences to the families of those killed.” [7]
After the massacre International Assistance Mission stated that they had no plans to leave Afghanistan. [57] US Federal Bureau of Investigation has opened an investigation into the attacks according a spokesman from US embassy. [57] [58]
Former Afghan presidential candidate Abdullah Abdullah who is a physician himself and trained with Tom Little deplored the killings and called the attackers "enemies of the Afghan people." [59]
United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , who emphasized that “health workers must have access to treat those in need and must be able to do so without fear.” [60] His Special Representative Staffan de Mistura said "The United Nations condemns this serious crime and apparent cold-blooded execution." [61]
Australian foreign minister Stephen Smith issued a statement condemning the attack and offered condolences to the victims' families. [62] British foreign secretary William Hague condemned the attack and stated "This is a deplorable and cowardly act which is against the interests of the people of Afghanistan who depended on the services she [Karen Woo] was bravely helping to provide." [9] United States Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton condemned the killings, calling them "despicable acts of wanton violence." (see above) [15] Karl Eikenberry , the current United States Ambassador to Afghanistan , speaking to Afghan people said, "Their murder demonstrates the absolute disregard that terrorist-inspired Taliban and other insurgents have for your health, have for your security and have for your opportunity, They don't care about your future. They only care about themselves and their own ideology." [34] US special envoy Richard Holbrooke stated the killers do not represent average Afghans, most of whom were shocked by these killings. [62]

2011 Fuzhou, Jiangxi bombings - Wikipedia, the free ... The 2011 Fuzhou bombings were three separate, synchronized explosions at government buildings in Fuzhou, Jiangxi, China on the morning of 26 May 2011. At least three ... 2011 Fuzhou bombings
Qian Mingqi (钱明奇; Pinyin : Qián Míngqí)
The 2011 Fuzhou bombings ( Simplified Chinese : 抚州市连环爆炸案; Pinyin : Fǔzhōu shì liánhuán bàozhà àn) were three separate, synchronized explosions at government buildings in Fuzhou, Jiangxi , China on the morning of 26 May 2011. At least three people died, and at least seven were injured. [1] The perpetrator, 52-year-old Qian Mingqi, was initially reported possibly among those killed in the blasts, [2] leading China's state run news agencies to label it a suicide bombing . [3] The Jiangxi Provincial Public Security Department later confirmed that the suspect died at the scene . [4]
The three explosions occurred between 9:18 and 9:45am CST (0100 UTC). [5] The first blast occurred in a parking lot outside the offices of the city prosecutor, the second inside a district administration office, and the third explosion hit the city's food and drug agency. [5] Two of the bombs were placed inside cars parked just outside of the buildings. [6] The official Xinhua news agency had posted a news article on its website saying the bombs were planted by a disgruntled farmer who was dissatisfied with the outcome of a court case , [7] but by 1pm on the day of the bombing the article had been removed from the site . [7]
Contents
In 1995 Qian Mingqi's home was demolished by government authorities to make way for a highway. He then saved up enough money to build a second home, which was also shattered by a second forced demolition. His second house cost about 500,000 yuan , and the authorities paid him only half of that for compensation. [8] Because of the lack of compensation, he posted slogans to resist the demolition. According to his neighbors, Qian's wife was then hung upside down by the demolition team. She died a few years later from gall bladder disease. From the police report of the Fuzhou Police, Qian's wife has been dead for several years. [9]
After the ordeal he then discovered the land seized from him to make a highway was actually not used. [8] By 2002 Qian began petitioning in Fuzhou and Beijing's government offices. Unable to find redress, he reportedly taught himself to use the internet, and cultivate a presence on various blogging platforms, hoping to get the attention of human rights defenders, academics, lawyers, reporters, and police. Not only did Qian fail to elicit the attention of anyone who might help him, but he became aware of other individuals who had similarly had their homes demolished. [10] In one of his blog he accused Linchuan district party cadre of embezzling 10 million yuan in compensation funds after demolishing his house and that of seven other families. [8] Qian had two sons and one daughter. [11]
Bombings, especially ones of this sophistication, are rare in China, [5] but this was the second in a month. Earlier in May 2011 in north-west Gansu province a " petrol bomb " was set off outside a bank by a former employee. [5] There are very few ways for the Chinese people to redress or raise awareness of what they see as a wrong they have suffered, and therefore, as the BBC 's Michael Bristow states, "some Chinese people occasionally take out their frustration in attacks like this." [5]
According to Mingqi's Sina Weibo site and the 2002 demolitions, Qian was fed up. The weibo posts state "Ten years of seeking redress resulted in nothing," [7] and "I was forced to step onto a road I didn't want to step on due to the loss of my newly built house, which was illegally demolished...my total loss was near to RMB two million Yuan." [12] [13] who wrote on Sina.com 's weibo ( microblogging ) service, Sina Weibo , that his home had been demolished illegally. [14] He wrote the last statement in his weibo: "I want to learn from Dong Cunrui [a People's Liberation Army soldier who carried an explosive package and blew up a bunker in 1948] and I hope I can receive the public's support and attention." [15]
The bombs were detonated by Qian Mingqi, aged 52 at the time, who was killed in the explosions. [7] Two victims are security guards of the Linchuan district government building, Xu Yingfu and He Haigen. [16]
"The first bomb, in a vehicle parked inside the gate of the local prosecutor's office, went off at about 9:15 a.m., according to local media reports. A second bomb detonated at 9:30 a.m. at a district government office, and a third bomb, believed to be a car bomb like the first, went off at 9:45 a.m. outside a local office of the State Food and Drug Administration." [17]
The explosion blew most of the windows out of the local prosecutor's office, an eight-story building, and at least ten cars were destroyed. [5]
Many Chinese bloggers, weibo and Twitter users expressed sympathy for Qian Mingqi, with some calling him a "hero", and comparing him to Yang Jia , who killed Shanghai policemen after allegedly suffering mistreatment. Following the bombings, Qian's weibo page had attracted some 30,000 followers, before being shut down by Sina administrators. [18] The Christian Science Monitor reported that most of the online commentators regarded Qian's actions not as a terrorist attack, but as "righteous vengeance:" "The flood of supportive comments online since his death is a sign of widespread public frustration at the government's disdain for ordinary citizens." VOA reported on 27 May that the death of Qian has sounded an alarm bell for Chinese government, and one blogger has said on his Twitter account:"...history will always remember Qian." [19] [20]
In an interview, Li Chengpeng, one of China's most popular and influential bloggers, said "Qian was no Bin Laden , he was one of the weak, he had no way to express himself nor defend his rights." [21]
The Associated Press explained the outpouring of sympathy for Qian by observing that many citizens could relate to his tale of victimization at the hands of authorities, and to his frustration at the lack of channels to seek redress. The Associated Press observed that "Qian's grievances resonate widely in China, where land disputes have mushroomed amid a fast-paced economic boom. Standoffs between tenants and developers often turn violent, with homeowners beaten by thugs or even crushed by bulldozers. Other tenants have set themselves on fire rather than face eviction." [22]
The state-run Global Times newspaper issued a report after the bombings calling for a condemnation of the violence, but also proposed that more needed to be done to understand why individuals like Qian are occasionally driven to lash out. The article quoted Mao Shoulong, a professor of public policy at Renmin University of China , saying that while extreme actions to seek redress should not be encouraged in any way, "At the same time, authorities should learn to open smoother channels for the public to file their complaints before problems turn into confrontations and then violence." [23]
"Despite enormous attention being paid to the cause of the attack, we must lament the deaths of innocent people whose families and friends are now suffering...This horrendous act, no matter its origin, deserves the most vehement condemnation," the author said in one article with title "Horrendous attacks deserve public condemnation" in the observer column of the Global Times.

To Found5dollar Please list the strong relationship between the incident and the censorship. I strongly hate internet censorship, but we should not emphasize this here. If you can type and read Chinese, you can easily find various Chinese news about this incident. Truthdigger 04:14, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
It is not beign emphasized, a few sentances, sourced, about how first responders to the site dealt with the media by erasing pictures and confiscating materials is extremely notable. The burden of proof to it's non-notability lies of you. The information is sourced and is related to the event. Once the article expands, hopefully with your help, a smaller percent will be devoted to the censorship because the rest of the article will have more mass. Please do not delete the section again untill you can prove that sourced information directly related to peopel involved with the event does not belong. -- Found5dollar ( talk ) 04:23, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
You didn't give the strong connection between a bombing and the censorship. And obviously, you can easily access to this incident both in English and Chinese. So I will insist deleting the unimportant and not-related parts and focus on the truth and progress behind this incident. I hope you can do some work to improve this part. Truthdigger 04:33, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
There was a bombing, people took pictures of it, reliable sources say the cops deleted said pictures. Censorship. I don't know how one can have any stronger of a connection.-- Found5dollar ( talk ) 04:46, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Don't use feel, please give reasons. List the logical relationship. Thanks. Don't be the judge. ( talk ) 04:58, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
By the way, I found that this incident may match up the requirement of this. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:N/CA#Criminal_acts
Maybe this is not suitable for an article,a better place to put his article is wikinews. Don't be the judge. ( talk ) 05:02, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
This article does not fall under "Criminal Acts." Please do not blank the page again. It is counterproductive.-- Found5dollar ( talk ) 05:19, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
You just deleted the "Censorship" section again statign that you can nto find the information in the reference. the ref clearly states "local police deleted photographs of the explosions taken by passersby, and later blocked roads in surrounding neighbourhoods. Little information was released by local authorities. " i am reinstating the section. please do nto delete it again-- Found5dollar ( talk ) 05:28, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Please supply the official orginal report about the suspect. And also there is no evidence that the external link is from you so called "suspect". Don't be the judge. ( talk ) 05:32, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
I have brought this article to the attention of the administrators noticeboard as you continue to delete sourced information as well as posts by other users on your talk page.-- Found5dollar ( talk ) 05:43, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
I am here to invite everyone to expand the incident. The background of the suspect and social debate content. Thanks. Truthdigger 12:17, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Right now this article only has 10 references. I'm sure there are more reliable sources covering this incident. In particular, this article should cite whatever the state media are now saying about it. {Heroeswithmetaphors talk} 13:44, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Ref 8 and 10 have exact the same content(It seems that one website reprint the news.). Can you just change to one link? MECHEMENG ( talk ) 22:49, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
How about 2011 Jiangxi bombings? (Heroeswithmetaphors) talk 18:40, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
The current title is much better. Truthdigger 19:07, 27 May 2011 (UTC)
Using simply "Jiangxi bombings" is too imprecise, as Jiangxi is a very big place. The use of the x (comma) y format is necessary; the current title distinguishes 撫州 "Fuzhou City" in Jiangxi Province to the 福州 " Fuzhou City" located in Fujian Province. --  李博杰  |

nice propaganda from The Christian Science Monitor , they should look at the most liked comments in this CNN article [1] . Why are some people supporting Joseph Andrew Stack and this guy is a good question for the psychologists , but the section for that in this article is not neutral. Pilotkjl ( talk ) 19:15, 28 May 2011 (UTC)
A number of news organizations and bloggers have picked up on the same angle as the CSM. I'm not sure why you think it constitutes propaganda, nor do I see how the parallel to Joseph Andrew Stack is relevant.
I would like to work on the response section to make it more complete. I have yet to find secondary sources that report on anything but the outpouring of sympathy that Qian received from the Chinese public, though I admittedly have not looked very hard. If you find some, you are most welcome to add them in, or direct me to them and I can do it. I also want to make clear that by reporting information on the expressions of popular support that Qian received, these news organizations are not endorsing that perspective. They are reporting on it because it says something about the state of China today, about the frustrations of its people and their attitudes on acceptable forms of protest, etc. I think it's worthy of inclusion on Wikipedia for the same reason—not because I endorse violence. Homunculus ( duihua ) 04:56, 29 May 2011 (UTC)
One thing we need to pay attention, the other two victims are weak people ( security guards ). Not government administrators. We need to find some news about response for their death. MECHEMENG ( talk ) 05:03, 29 May 2011 (UTC)
Good idea. As I said, I have yet to find good secondary sources commenting on that aspect of the response, but that owes to not looking very hard. If you find something, please add it in. Homunculus ( duihua ) 05:15, 29 May 2011 (UTC)
If no one protests, I am going to remove the tags on the section now that it's been updated. Homunculus ( duihua ) 04:55, 31 May 2011 (UTC)

The 2011 Fuzhou bombings ( Simplified Chinese : 抚州市连环爆炸案; Pinyin : Fǔzhōu shì liánhuán bàozhà àn) were three separate, synchronized explosions at government buildings in Fuzhou, Jiangxi , China on the morning of 26 May 2011. At least three people died, and at least seven were injured. The perpetrator, 52-year-old Qian Mingqi, was initially reported possibly among those killed in the blasts, leading China's state run news agencies to label it a suicide bombing . The Jiangxi Provincial Public Security Department later confirmed that the suspect died at the scene .
The three explosions occurred between 9:18 and 9:45am CST (0100 UTC). The first blast occurred in a parking lot outside the offices of the city prosecutor, the second inside a district administration office, and the third explosion hit the city's food and drug agency. Two of the bombs were placed inside cars parked just outside of the buildings. The official Xinhua news agency had posted a news article on its website saying the bombs were planted by a disgruntled farmer who was dissatisfied with the outcome of a court case , but by 1pm on the day of the bombing the article had been removed from the site .

Nadahan wedding bombing - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia The Nadahan wedding bombing was a suicide attack on a wedding party, which occurred on 9 June 2010 at around 21:00 local time (16:30 GMT) in the village of Nadahan in ... Contents
The enormous explosion occurred in a men-only area of the wedding party. [3] They were all sitting down and eating at the time of the event. [4] A white-clothed boy under the age of 13 wandered in and approached within 15 feet of the dinner tables before fiddling with the bomb attached to his vest, causing a chaotic scene. [5] There was a ball of fire and some smoke. [4] The women were elsewhere, inside another building. [4] Some of those killed were children. [3] The groom was among the wounded. [3] His brother died. [5] His bride remained unharmed throughout the incident. [4]
At least three police officers from Afghanistan were involved in the wedding. [4] Others suggested the attack was intended for 17 of the guests who were members of an anti-Taliban guard group, which had once been encouraged by the American Special Operations Forces before they gave up on it. [6] Blood donations were requested via television. [3] The coffins of the dead were lined adjacent to the mortuary. [3]
A group of investigators was sent to the village by Afghanistan's Interior Ministry. [5]
NATO issued a statement claiming none of their soldiers were behind it. [4] The Taliban were instead blamed by the NATO troops; however, the Taliban has stated that they were not responsible for the attack, [3] even condemning it as "a brutal act". [3] Deputy commander of NATO forces, Lt. Gen. Nick Parker , described it as "ruthless violence" and claimed these were "sickening and indiscriminate tactics to try to intimidate the citizens of Afghanistan". [4]
A military spokesperson representing the United States said the attack had not been an airstrike carried out by his country. [4] He dismissed speculation to the contrary as "Taliban misinformation". [4]
President Hamid Karzai stated his condemnation and requested "a thorough investigation". [4] Karzai, in the presence of the United Kingdom's Prime Minister David Cameron (who was visiting Afghanistan for the first official time), labelled it "a crime of massive inhuman proportions". [7]
Tooryalai Wesa , governor of the Kandahar Province , spoke at a news conference in Nadahan after the attack had happened and demonstrated a piece of metal he had found which he said resembled a suicide bomb. [4]
United Nations Special Representative for Afghanistan Staffan de Mistura said it was an "outrageous act" and that "to specifically target people who were gathering at a moment of happiness to celebrate a wedding shows a total disregard for civilian life". [5]

Battle of Doan - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia Nadahan wedding bombing; Hamkari; Dragon Strike; Baawar; Kandahar; Eastern Afghanistan. Hazar Qadam; Anaconda ; ... Nadahan (2010) Logar (2011) Nimruz (2011) LT
LT
Several Bushmaster vehicles
US air support and QRF assets Unknown number of Taliban fighters Casualties and losses 1 Australian wounded
1 Bushmaster destroyed Unconfirmed number of fighters killed/or injured
1 local arrested on suspicion.
The village of Doan is located in the western part of Oruzgan Province which is often called the "Wild West of Oruzgan" due to the high level of violent attacks. One of the most remote outposts in Oruzgan is Patrol Base Tinsley, which is where Australians train their Afghan colleagues. Part of their training involves patrols in order to halt the advance of the Taliban. The Australians and ANA conducted a three day joint patrol to the village of Doan. During this time, they were constantly being engaged by sporadic fire from the 'green zone'.
On 9 September 2011 a joint patrol of Australians from Combat Team Charlie, Mentoring Task Force 3 and ANA troops came under Taliban fire near Doan. The patrol made its way through the village before exchanging fire on the outskirts of Doan. RPGs and a mortar crew added to the coalition's firepower. During the battle, a Bushmaster vehicle was destroyed when it hit an IED whilst under fire, a digger was wounded and airlifted to hospital. The Taliban eventually fortified themselves on a hill and managed to counter all attacks. The fighting dragged on well into the night until an airstrike was called in and US fighter jets bombarded Taliban positions, ending the battle.
The Australian who was wounded was airlifted to a Coalition hospital in Tarin Kowt and treated for his injuries. A squad of US soldiers of the 29th Infantry Division who had been assigned as the security force for the region's Civil Affairs forces, assisted in the Quick Reaction Force (QRF), casevac, and resupply of Australian forces after providing QRF and casevac to American Special Forces who were concurrently operating north of their position in the Kod Valley. It is estimated that a small number of Taliban were killed during the battle, primarily due to the airstrike. During the battle, the Australians arrested a local Afghan on suspicion of aiding the Taliban. No civilians were killed or injured and the village of Doan was secured. [1] [2] [3]

Attack type
Car bombing
The October 2010 Abuja attacks otherwise 2010 Nigeria Independence Day attacks, were two car bombings carried out against crowds celebrating the fiftieth anniversary (golden jubilee) of Nigeria 's independence in the capital city of Abuja on the morning of October 1, 2010. The attacks left 12 dead and 17 injured. According to multiple sources, [1] [2] the Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta (MEND) issued a warning less than an hour before the first bomb stating the location, near Eagle Square (the venue of the celebration), and the time, around 10:30 a.m., of planned bombings. [3]
The first blast occurred around 10:30 a.m., emergency services arrived at the scene and then happened the second blast. [2]
Reactions and investigation[ edit ]
A former leader of MEND, Henry Okah , was arrested in South Africa following the twin car bombings. [4] Okah denied accusations of planning the bombings and was disowned by MEND. [5] Police in Nigeria also detained Raymond Dokpesi , campaign manager for former Nigerian leader Ibrahim Babangida , for questioning over the bombing. Dokpesi was later released and said his arrest was political in nature. [6]
Nigerian paper This Day reported that British intelligence was warned of a plot against the 50th anniversary celebrations, and this was the reason Gordon Brown and Prince Richard, Duke of Gloucester cancelled their trips to Nigeria for the celebration. [7]

Flagging-off of his presidential campaign in Lagos today, President Goodluck Jonathan told a crowd of party faithful that the leader of the Movement for the Emancipation of Niger Delta (MEND), Henry Okah, was procured by some Nigerians to assassinate him. Nigerian and South African intelligence, he said, however foiled the plot. In 2010, when MEND claimed responsibility for the Nigeria’s Independence Day bomb explosions in Abuja, Mr. Jonathan absolved the group of blame even when MEND announced that Jonathan had asked it to blame Northerners for the explosions. Speaking further today, Mr. Jonathan suggested that MEND's endorsement of Buhari for next month’s presidential election means that Mr. Okah has political connections with the All Progressives Congress (APC) and its presidential candidate, Muhammadu Buhari.

Boko Haram ("Western education is forbidden"), officially called Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'Awati Wal-Jihad ("People Committed to the Prophet's Teachings for Propagation and Jihad"), is a terrorist, militant and Islamist movement based in northeast Nigeria with additional activities in Chad, Niger and Cameroon.[4] The group is led by Abubakar Shekau, and membership has been estimated to number between a few hundred and a few thousand. The group is designated as a terrorist organization by New Zealand, Australia, the United Kingdom, Canada, the United States and the United Nations Security Council, which declared it an al-Qaeda affiliate and imposed the al-Qaeda sanctions regime on the group.[4][15][16] Boko Haram killed more than 5,000 civilians between July 2009 and June 2014, including at least 2,000 in the first half of 2014, in attacks occurring mainly in northeast, north-central and central Nigeria.[17][18][19] Corruption in the security services and human rights abuses committed by them have hampered efforts to counter the unrest.[20][21] Since 2009 Boko Haram have abducted more than 500 men,[22][23] women and children, including the kidnapping of 276 schoolgirls from Chibok in April 2014.[24] 650,000 people had fled the conflict zone by August 2014, an increase of 200,000 since May; by the end of the year 1.5 million had fled.[25][26] After its founding in 2002, Boko Haram's increasing radicalisation led to a violent uprising in July 2009 in which its leader was executed. Its unexpected resurgence, following a mass prison break in September 2010, was accompanied by increasingly sophisticated attacks, initially against soft targets, and progressing in 2011 to include suicide bombings on police buildings and the United Nations office in Abuja. The government's establishment of a state of emergency at the beginning of 2012, extended in the following year to cover the entire northeast of the country, resulted in a marked increase in both security force abuses and militant attacks. The Nigerian military proved ineffective in countering the insurgency, hampered by an entrenched culture of official corruption. Since mid-2014, the militants have been in control of swathes of territory in and around their home state of Borno, but have not captured the capital of Borno state, Maiduguri, where the group was originally based. As of January 2015, Boko Haram controlled towns and villages across about 20,000 square miles, an area the size of Belgium, in the states of Borno and Yobe.[

2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks - Wikipedia, the ... 2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks. From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia. Jump to: navigation, search. 2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks; Site of the attacks
Deaths
6 Israeli civilians, 1 Israeli soldier, 1 Israeli Yamam policeman, 5 Egyptian soldiers, 10 attackers [2]
Non-fatal injuries
Perpetrators
Presumably 12 assailants. Israel has stated that the attacks were orchestrated by the Gaza based Popular Resistance Committees , who deny involvement. [4] Egyptian sources report that three of the attackers were Sinai-based Egyptians. [2] [5]
On August 18, 2011, a series of cross-border attacks with parallel attacks and mutual cover was carried out in southern Israel on Highway 12 near the Egyptian border by a squad of presumably 12 militants in four groups. [2] The attacks occurred after Israel's interior security service Shin Bet had warned of an attack by militants in the region and Israeli troops had been stationed in the area. [6] The militants first opened fire at an Egged No. 392 bus as it was traveling on Highway 12 in the Negev near Eilat . [3] [7] Several minutes later, a bomb was detonated next to an Israeli army patrol along Israel's border with Egypt. In a third attack, an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians. [8] Eight Israelis – six civilians, one Yamam special unit police sniper and one Golani Brigade soldier—were killed in the multiple-stage attack. [9] [10] The Israel Defense Forces reported eight attackers killed, and Egyptian security forces reported killing another two. [2]
Five Egyptian soldiers were also killed. According to Egypt, they were killed by Israeli security forces chasing militants across the Egyptian border, while an Israeli military officer initially said they were killed by a suicide bomber who had fled across the border into Egypt. [11] The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between Egypt and Israel and led to mass protests outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo. According to media reports, Egypt threatened to withdraw its ambassador to Israel, but Egypt's foreign minister later denied this. [2] Israel expressed regret over the deaths, and sent a letter of apology to Egypt. [12] The IDF was ordered to conduct a military probe of the incident, [13] [14] and on August 25, 2011, Israel agreed to a joint investigation with Egypt of the events. [15]
The identity of the attackers, three of whom were reportedly Egyptian, [16] is not widely agreed upon, [17] and so far no group took responsibility for the attacks. The Israeli government accused the Palestinian Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), a Gaza -based coalition of Palestinian militant groups, of orchestrating the attacks, [18] but the PRC denies involvement. [19] However, Israel attacked seven targets in the Gaza Strip immediately after the terror attacks in the Negev, killing five members of the PRC, including its leader. [20]
On August 21, 2011, an informal ceasefire was called by Israel and Hamas after days of escalating violence in which fifteen Palestinians were killed and many were wounded. More than 100 rockets and mortar shells were fired from Gaza into Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding more than a dozen. [21] The ceasefire was broken almost immediately by rocket fire from Gaza on southern Israel, followed by retaliatory Israeli airstrikes, killing at least seven Palestinians, among them two leaders of the Islamic Jihad . On August 26, 2011, Gaza militants called a second truce. [22] On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , Zuhir al-Qaisi , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks. [23]

The southern part of Israeli Highway 12 runs adjacent to Israel's border with Egypt. It was the scene of previous shooting attacks in the 1990s.[ citation needed ] In the late 2000s, the Israeli government decided to build the Israel–Egypt barrier , although by 2011 only 10% of it had been completed, none close to the site of the attack. [24]
Following the 2011 Egyptian revolution militant organizations increased their activity in the Sinai Peninsula and Al-Qaeda militants groups were established, [25] after Egyptian police had all but completely withdrawn from the northern Sinai, dominated by Bedouin tribes. During the months preceding the cross-border attacks, Egypt reinforced its forces with about 1,000 additional soldiers in the Sinai Peninsula, with the consent of Israel, after a series of five bombings had disrupted the flow of natural gas to Israel. [26]
On July 30, militants staged an attack on an Egyptian police station in El-Arish, killing six. [27]
On August 2, a group claiming to be the Sinai wing of Al Qaeda declared its intention to create an Islamic caliphate in the Sinai. [28]
On August 14, 2011, Egyptian forces swept the Sinai Peninsula in search of terror cells. [29] Jordanian intelligence informed the Israelis that they had information about an impending terror attack in the south of Israel. [30] Two days prior to the attack, the Egyptian army captured four Islamist insurgents as they prepared to blow up a gas pipeline in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula. [31]
Israeli interior security service Shin Bet had warned of terrorist attacks being planned in the region in an area 80 kilometers long, presuming that they would take place at night. The warnings led to a massive deployment of IDF troops, [6] and the closing of Highway 12, which was reopened only on the day of the attack at the order of head of IDF's southern command Tal Russo . [32]
August 18 cross-border attacks and immediate Israeli response[ edit ]
The original attacks occurred in three coordinated stages. [8] They were carried out by 12 militants in four groups dispersed over an area 12 kilometers long. At least some of the attackers wore brown uniforms, similar to those used by the Egyptian Army . [2] Israeli military and police forces, in cooperation with Shin Bet , began pursuing the perpetrators immediately after the attacks commenced and locked down the area. [33]
The attacks commenced around 12:00 pm (UTC+2) near the Ein Netafim spring, on Highway 12 from Mitzpe Ramon to Eilat , when three militants spread out about 200 meters from one another, [10] armed with suicide bomb vests, grenades , RPGs , and machine guns opened fire on an Egged passenger bus on line 392, carrying mostly soldiers but also some civilians. [8] Seven passengers were wounded, most of them soldiers. [34] According to eyewitnesses, a white car was following the bus, and a group of people dressed in military uniforms got out and opened fire. The bus driver, Benny Belevsky, did not stop the bus and sped away, getting to an IDF post near the Netafim Border Crossing . [35]
The militants, dressed in brown uniforms resembling those of the Egyptian Army, then began attacking passing vehicles, waving white handkerchiefs to fool motorists. [2] One of the militants attacked a bus that drove by and detonated the suicide bomb belt he was wearing, killing himself and the bus driver, who had stopped the empty bus. [34] Another militant opened fire at a passing car and killed the female driver. The same militant then fired an RPG at an Israeli Air Force helicopter, but missed. An IDF jeep from the Golani Brigade then arrived at the scene and ran over the militant, killing him. [10] Another Golani Brigade jeep arrived, and ran over a roadside bomb. As the soldiers exited the damaged vehicle, the surviving militant opened fire at them. Soldiers and Yamam special police officers then located the militant and killed him in a gunbattle. Two other militants then opened fire at the from Egyptian territory. Israeli forces briefly crossed the border and killed both of the militants. One Israeli soldier was killed by friendly fire during the engagement and several soldiers were wounded. [36] [37] [38] [39] The Egyptian Army informed the IDF that its soldiers killed two more militants in the Sinai. [10]
In the third attack, which occurred around 12:35, mortar shells were fired at soldiers carrying out routine maintenance work at the security fence constructed along the border between Israel and Egypt. No one was hurt in the attack. [33] [40]
Around 13:30, not far from the first shooting incident, militants opened fire, including with an anti-tank missile , at a bus and private car on route 90, a desert road near the border with Jordan . According to medics, five people were killed in the attacks. [7] Seven people were wounded when another private vehicle was hit by an anti-tank missile. Eyewitnesses suggested that some of the attackers may have been wearing Egyptian Army uniforms. [41] Two IAF helicopters were called to the scene in order to evacuate those wounded.
IDF medic Anastasia Bagdalov was awarded military commendation for her response to the attack. She was a passenger on the bus that was attacked by militants. Begdlov used her bra as a tourniquet on a severely wounded passenger's artery.
Around 18:30, an Israeli patrol was fired on from the Egyptian border as it searched for militants. Israeli troops returned fire, and the shooting lasted for about an hour. A sniper from the Yamam special police unit was critically wounded and later died. News of the firefight interrupted a briefing by the Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Chief of Staff Benny Gantz . [42] [43] [44]
According to an Egyptian probe, Israeli troops entered the Sinai Peninsula chasing after the terrorists, exchanging fire with Egyptian police, and an Israeli helicopter fired two rockets at the terrorists and machine guns at Egyptian security personnel, killing an Egyptian officer and two policemen. [2] In a later incident, first reported as a suicide bomb attack, [45] another two Egyptian soldiers were killed, presumably also by Israeli forces. [2] Some Israeli sources claimed that an IDF investigation said that the IDF's attack helicopters avoided hitting the Egyptian military and that it remains unclear who fired the deadly shots. [46]
The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries and lead to mass protests in Cairo outside the Israeli embassy. [47]
Following the attack, all roads to and from Eilat were sealed off and operations at Ovda Airport were suspended. Roadblocks were set up at the entrance to the city of Eilat, and the area was locked down. Magen David Adom (Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service) raised its alert level and began preparing teams of paramedics and medical equipment. The Israeli Air Force sent in Eilat police deployed a large number of security forces and a police war room was opened at the Yoseftal Medical Center . Seven of the 29 injured people who were brought to the Yoseftal Medical Center were later transferred to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba . [30] The police asked the public to expect roadblocks at the entrance to Eilat amidst a heavy police presence in the city; however later in the day they added that no security incidents were under way in either Eilat or Beersheba despite calling for public vigilance and for the public-at-large to contact police in case of any suspicious individuals or items.

According to SITE a group calling itself Ansar Jerusalem claimed responsibility for the attack. [61] Nevertheless, Israel stated that it possesses evidence that indicate that the attacks were orchestrated by the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) in Gaza. [7] [62]
The (PRC) denied any involvement in the attack, though they praised it. According to PRC spokesman, "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems ". [63] According to Haaretz, there is doubt in Gaza, that members of the Popular Resistance Committees were behind the attack. The Egyptian daily Al-Masry Al-Youm reported that Egyptian security forces identified three of those responsible for the attack as Egyptians. [64]
Hamas, which governs Gaza, also denied involvement. [65] Sky News quoted Hamas spokesman Taher al-Nunu as saying: "The Palestinian government denies the accusations made by Barak about the operation in Eilat and affirms that there is no relation between the Gaza Strip and what happened near Eilat." [66] Hamas did, however, "praise" the attack. [67]
The Washington Times reported that US intelligence agencies linked Al Qaeda to the attack, claiming that either the PRC or the Gaza-based Jaish al Islam carried out the attacks. [68]
August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids
Casualties and losses None 14 Palestinians killed including at least 6 senior PRC militants; "scores" injured [69] [70]
At 18.00 the Israeli Air Force , [71] working with Shin Bet , [7] bombed a building used by Popular Resistance Committees' members in Rafah . Five PRC members were killed. Among the dead was the PRC's commander Kamal al-Nairab and military chief Immad Hammad, [72] [73] [74] who was suspected by Shin Bet of having planned the attacks. Of the remaining three, two were top members. [7] The two-year-old son of one of the militants, who was in the building when it was attacked, was also killed. [72] The airstrike occurred in the southern Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border. [75] [76] The PRC responded to the attack in saying that it vows "double" revenge. [7] Later, the Israeli Air Force launched a wave of attacks against targets in Gaza. A home near the former Palestinian intelligence headquarters was hit, reportedly killing one and wounding seventeen, and starting a large fire in the area. Israeli aircraft fired three missiles at a building used by Hamas security forces, and bombed a Hamas outpost in Khan Yunis . A missile was also fired at an open area in the southern Gaza Strip. Several targets were bombed in the northern Gaza Strip, including a building used by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades . Several targets were hit around the Philadelphi Route , believed to have been smuggling tunnels. [77] Numerous rocket-launching cells were attacked during the airstrikes. Three Palestinian militants were killed as they participated in the firing of rockets, and senior PRC member Samed Abdul Mu'ty Abed was killed while riding a motorcycle in northern Gaza. Another man was injured in the attack that killed Abed. [21] [78] [79]
The Israeli Air Force bombed two tunnels and one warehouse used for manufacturing weapons in southern Gaza and one site used for militant activities. The tunnels had been used to allow assailants to infiltrate Israel and carry out attacks according to a statement released by the IDF Spokesperson's Unit . The IAF identified direct hits, and all aircraft returned to Israel safely. [80] An airstrike in central Gaza targeting a car killed a Palestinian militant, his five-year-old son, and his brother. [73] [81]
On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed Zuhir al-Qaisi , the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks, and his collaborator, Mahmoud Hanani. [23]
Palestinian militant response to Israeli air strikes[ edit ]
After the Israeli Air Force attacked targets in the Gaza Strip, at least 10 rockets were fired into southern Israel, hitting the cities of Ashkelon and Beersheba , causing no injuries. [82] Two additional rockets landed in a courtyard of a Yeshiva in Ashdod , wounding 10 people and lightly damaging the buildings. [83] [84] The Abdullah Azzam Shaheed Brigade , a radical Islamic group affiliated with Al Qaeda , claimed responsibility for the attack. [85]
August 21st rocket attacks
Perpetrators
Over 80 rockets launched from Gaza hit cities in Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding over a dozen. [88] Seven rockets were fired almost simultaneously at Beersheba . The Iron Dome rocket defense system intercepted five of them, but one hit a residential area and killed Israeli Yossi Shushan. The Lachish subdistrict was hit by 28 rockets and the Negev subdistrict was hit by nine rockets. Four Israelis from the Bnei Shimon Regional Council were injured while running for shelter in Beersheba. Three Palestinians working in Israel were injured by Grad rockets after they exploded in a field in southern Ashdod . Vehicles and homes were damaged by rockets in Israeli cities near Gaza. [89] [90]
A Grad rocket exploded near the coastal city of Ashkelon in the night, though no injuries or damage were reported. It was unknown whether the rocket was intercepted by the Iron Dome , though it was confirmed that a second rocket was intercepted. [91] On August 21, an additional 12 rockets were fired at Israel. Three were intercepted by the Iron Dome in Ashkelon. One of the rockets hit an empty high school building in Beersheba. No one was in the school because "the city had canceled educational activities in light of the missile attacks that Palestinians in Gaza have been launching against the south in the last few days" according to Beersheba deputy mayor Heftziba Zohar. Later that night, a rocket killed a dog. [92] [93] [94]
Barrages of rockets were fired at Beersheba and Ashkelon. Half of them were intercepted by the Iron Dome . Mortar shells fired at farmland in the Eshkol Regional Council contained phosphorus , which is designed to create a more intense fire after detonation. [95] 40 rockets were fired on Sunday. [96] Several structures were damaged and a car caught fire after two rockets were fired at Ashkelon. A three-month-old infant was injured by glass splinters. [97]
A 13-year-old Palestinian boy, Mahmoud Abu Samra, was killed during the rocket attacks when a Palestinian Grad rocket fell short and landed in Gaza. [81]
An informal ceasefire was agreed upon between Israel and Hamas after the Arab League held an "urgent meeting" in Cairo on August 21, 2011. [98] Some 20 minutes after the ceasefire came into effect, a barrage of Qassam rockets and mortar shells was fired at Israel. The Iron Dome intercepted two rockets fired at Ashkelon. The Israeli Air Force attacked a militant cell in the northern Gaza Strip, wounding several people. The Islamic Jihad Movement and the Popular Resistance Committees said that they would not accept a ceasefire. [99]
On August 23, four Qassam rockets were fired at Israel in breach of the ceasefire. The rockets landed in open areas and caused no casualties, but one caused a brushfire which spread to an area near two civilian communities and threatened local greenhouses . Firefighters managed to contain the blaze before it did any damage. [100]
On August 24, more than 20 rockets were fired at Israeli communities. Grad rockets targeted the cities of Beersheba, Ashkelon, and Ofakim , injuring a nine-month-old baby. In Gaza, a senior Islamic Jihad member who funded the cross-border attacks was killed and two others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a car. Israeli jets also fired at two militants after they were seen preparing to fire rockets. Several hours after the strike, two mortar shells landed in the western Negev, causing no casualties. [101] Seven rockets were fired at Southern Israel, causing no damage or casualties. The Israeli Air Force attacked an Islamic Jihad rocket-launching cell, killing one militant. According to Palestinian media, the IDF fired shells at a militant squad in eastern Gaza after a rocket attack, but the cell escaped the strike. [102] On August 25, the Islamic Jihad Movement announced that it would abide by the ceasefire. The same day, 15 rockets and mortar shells hit Southern Israel, hitting open areas near Ashkelon and in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council . A mortar shell heavily damaged the Erez Crossing Terminal . Israel responded with airstrikes on several targets in the Gaza Strip. The two Islamic Jihad militants who had launched the mortar attack on the Erez Crossing were killed by an airstrike as traveled on their motorbike in northern Gaza. [103] On August 26, two Qassam rockets hit open areas in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council , and a Grad rocket exploded near Ashkelon. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility. [104]
On August 21, 2011, media reported that the Egyptian authorities were recalling the Egyptian ambassador in Israel in response to the killing of five Egyptian security officers by Israeli soldiers after the attacks near Eilat. [105] Egypt's foreign minister later stated that "at no point was there any intention on our part to recall our ambassador to Tel Aviv." [57]
Following the media reports about the killing of the Egyptian security officers, demonstrations against Israel erupted in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy. The demonstrators threw fire crackers at the building, unfurled a Palestinian flag, and called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in response to the killings. [11] Eventually a young Egyptian, Ahmed Al-Shahhat , climbed to the roof of the apartment building which houses the Israeli Embassy and removed the Israeli flag, replacing it with an Egyptian flag he had carried with him, becoming an instant folk hero in Egypt. The Israeli flag he had taken down was burned by protesters. [106] During the demonstrations which continued for several days, thousands of protesters, shouting anti Israel slogans, called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador, the recalling of Egyptian ambassador to Israel, a review of the Camp David Accords and the opening of the border with the Gaza Strip. [26] [107] On Friday, August 26, 2011, a demonstration announced as "Million-man demonstration to expel the Israeli ambassador" took place in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy, [108] drawing a few hundred protesters according to Haaretz . [109]
Israeli apology to Egypt[ edit ]
In October 2011, the New York Times reported that Israel had sent a letter of apology to Egypt for the killing of the Egyptian security officers by Israeli forces. [12]
 Israel:
President Shimon Peres said "The series of severe terror events are an attempt by terror organizations to murder innocent civilians within Israel, and to disrupt our lives" [110]
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that this was a "serious incident in which Israeli citizens were hurt and the country's sovereignty was harmed." [111] [112]
Defense Minister Ehud Barak stated "this is a grave terrorist incident in a number of locations. The incident reflects the weakness of Egypt's hold over Sinai and the spread of terrorist elements." [113] He also blamed the attacks on Gazans and pledged that Israel will respond. "The source of the terror incidents is Gaza and we will act against them with all our strength and determination." [114] He also expressed regret over the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers and ordered the IDF to conduct a military probe of the incident, and defense officials said it would likely be a joint probe with the participation of the Egyptian military. [13]
Palestinian Authority Chief-negotiator Saeb Erekat stated "Israel stands warned of any possible aggressive action or collective punishment measures against the Palestinian population in Gaza." Erekat stated that the Palestinian Authority is "against violence in all its forms," however, he added that such attacks should not be used by Israel as "a pretext for aggression."
Hamas denied responsibility for the attacks but praised the attacks "...since they were against soldiers." [115] Hamas warned Israel not to attack the Gaza Strip, following a statement by Defense Minister Ehud Barak that the IDF would strike back at the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza following a deadly triple terror attack. Hamas evacuated its command centers and sent senior commanders into hiding in anticipation of an IDF response. [116]
Popular Resistance Committee (PRC) spokesperson praised the attacks but said his group does not take any responsibility for launching it: "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems." [117]
Tawheed and Jihad , an al-Qaeda -linked group in the Gaza Strip, praised the attacks and said the "Jewish state should expect more." Over the internet, the group said "We in the Tawheed and Jihad group bless these blessed arms that pounded the fortifications of the vendetta-filled Jewish enemy in the so-called Eilat area in southern occupied Palestine." [118] [119]
Supranational
 United Nations – UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday strongly condemned the attack but called for restraint. According to a UN statement, "the secretary-general hopes that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and brought to justice. He is concerned at the risk of escalation and calls for all to act with restraint." [121]
 European Union – EU Chief Catherine Ashton condemned the attacks, and said "I have learned with deep concern of the series of terrorist attacks that has taken place in Southern Israel today, including against civilian targets, and in which several Israelis are reported to have lost their lives and many more to have been injured. I condemn unreservedly all such acts of terror, extend my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in these attacks and express my wishes for a full and speedy recovery to the injured." [122] [123]
The Middle East Quartet in a joint statement condemned the attacks and expressed concern "about the unsustainable situation in Gaza as well as the risk of escalation", and called for "restraint from all sides". [120]
International
 Bulgaria – The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks, saying: "We express our sincere condolences to the relatives of all victims. We are convinced that violence and terrorism cannot bring peace to the Middle East. Such acts do not help the efforts of the international community to bring the participants in the Middle East peace process back to the negotiations table." [124]
 Canada – Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird condemned the attacks, saying: “Canada condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in southern Israel today. These cowardly attacks, particularly on civilian targets, are abhorrent and criminal. On behalf of all Canadians, I send my heartfelt condolences to those affected by today’s vicious attacks.” Furthermore, Baird said: "“Israel has a right to defend itself against such terrorist acts in conformity with international humanitarian law. Those responsible for these horrific attacks must be held accountable.” [125]
 Costa Rica – The Ministry of Foreign Relations published an article condemning the attack, communicating its condolences to the people of Israel, specially to the victims and families of the murdered. The article stated that Costa Rica, as a peace loving country, respectful of all human rights, expresses its most energetic disapproval of any kind of violence or terrorist attacks, regardless of the motives behind it. [126]
 Germany – Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also condemned the attacks saying: "At this difficult hour we stand by the side of our Israeli friends. Those responsible must be prosecuted. Terror and violence must not be allowed to torpedo peace and negotiation efforts in the Middle East." [127]
 Italy – Italian Foreign Affairs Minister, Franco Frattini, condemned the "barbaric" attacks on southern Israel and warned the international community to prevent more such attacks due to the unrest in the Arab world. He said: "I would like to express my condolences and closeness to the Israeli people and government for the loss of life in the barbaric attacks today." [128]
 Netherlands – The Dutch Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms." [129]
 Norway – Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Gahr Støre "condemned in the strongest possible terms" the acts of terror, adding that Norway condemns all use of terror [130]
 United Kingdom – Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said that "I condemn these appalling and senseless acts of violence. As efforts for peace in the region continue, this brutality has no place, nor its perpetrators any excuse. My thoughts and prayers are with those killed and injured and I offer sincere condolences to their families and friends."
 USA – The State Department condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms," calling the attack "brutal and cowardly." Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said "We hope that those involved in the planning of these gruesome attacks will be brought to swift justice. We stand by Israel as our friend, partner, and ally – now and always." [131] She also added that "This violence only underscores our strong concerns about the security situation in the Sinai Peninsula. Recent commitments by the Egyptian government to address the security situation in the Sinai are important and we urge the Egyptian government to find a lasting resolution." [132]
 Russia – Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman by telephone. Lavrov expressed his condolences over the terrorist attacks in southern Israel. He condemned this extremist act, and "reaffirmed the immutable position of Russia that there can be no justification for terror or for those who use it as means to achieve their ends". He also said that "despite the gravity of the crime, it is necessary to exercise restraint and to avoid retaliatory steps from which innocent people may suffer". [133]
Following the attacks on Highway 12, Israel is reportedly to soon allow Egypt to deploy thousands of troops in the Sinai Peninsula in violation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, in which both countries agreed that the Sinai Peninsula will be a military-free zone. [15]
According to Haaretz, the IDF General Staff's investigation into the attack “was a source of great frustration”. An intelligence alert from the Shin Bet had led to a massive deployment of IDF troops in the area, but the forces' alertness had eroded, allowing the militants to track the IDF and choose their infiltration route. The decision not to close the road on the morning of the attack in spite of warnings from the Shin Beth is characterised as “understandable error of judgment, and definitely not a manifestation of carelessness”, whereas the appearance of the defense minister and the chief of staff at the scene of the incident while terrorists were still in the area is considered a serious security blunder that nearly culminated in another disaster.

This article has recently been created in order to cover the Gaza arena of the 2011 southern Israel attacks . It seems there might be a problem covering the Gaza arena as a WP:DUE event, outside the context of the southern Israel attacks, as well as WP:RS relation to this arena as such. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:26, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
These attacks deserve an article of their own, not just a small section within an already excisting article. These attacks are notable - they led to truce between Israel and Hamas being broken. Polozooza ( talk ) 21:29, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Do you have a source for that? Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:30, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Sure I do. The first thing google gives me if I type in "gaza+attack+truce+hamas" is this one . Plenty of sources, both online and offline, can be found that mention these airstrikes as the direct reason for the truce to end. Polozooza ( talk ) 21:33, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Are you joking? i asked WP:RS, not "antiwar" blog. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:36, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
No jokes, just being lazy. ;) It was the first thing that showed up. There are plenty of other sources to be found. Polozooza ( talk ) 21:43, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
While you might be currently in some laziness state, i suggest you make notice of WP:SOAP and WP:OR rules in your free time. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:56, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
There are plenty out there, and im sure on that page too
Im neutral on this, though merging the two and changing the title would make 1 better article instead of 2 shitty ones. Alternatively, to satisfy two possible biases on such 1rr articles, we could paraphrase this on the section f the response on that article and "main" link it here.
Also not to sure that anti-war is the best source, but tehre are plenty Lihaas ( talk ) 21:32, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
With a little work, both articles could easily upgrade above the level "shitty". The other article isn't that bad, either. This one could be (and should be) just as good. The events described, and the results of these events, are certainly noteworthy. Polozooza ( talk ) 21:35, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Both articles seem perfectly justified. I see no reason to merge. Surely we can figure that out later if its appropriate. -- Eraserhead1 < talk > 22:04, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Indeed, and while this article is linked on many pages and on the Main Page, we should strive to expand it as much a possible and make it a proper article. All those templates don't look very nice for readers, I think. ;) Polozooza ( talk ) 22:07, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
I removed the orange tags as they didn't make any sense. -- Eraserhead1 < talk > 23:05, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
I also think this article should be merged into 2011 southern Israel attacks . קולנואני ( talk ) 22:37, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Support merger. קולנואני ( talk ) 21:53, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I think that the best solution would be to have two separate articles. Or take the Gaza raids information to the 2011 southern Israel attacks article as expansion. But until that is made properly I support two articles.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 22:44, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
The way the article stands this has more Gaza reaction to the attack and that has more of the other (which was dubious per ITN). i now strongly support a merge and name change to something like August 2011 Israel-Gaza militant tensions or August 2011 Israel-Gaza attacks ( Lihaas ( talk ) 23:33, 20 August 2011 (UTC)).
Support Move to sandbox or merge per WP:CFORK Wikifan
23:38, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Support merger. The two articles are strongly related. They can always be resplit. Metallurgist ( talk ) 23:38, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Most people dont seem to agree with the interpretation of fork, hnece consensus generating discussions
Metallurgist, whats the point in that? you havent explained.( Lihaas ( talk ) 00:01, 21 August 2011 (UTC)).
Oppose. They look like separate events in separate locations. One in the Aqaba gulf and one in Gaza. Nightw 01:34, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Seem like what? Everything is in this article is in the other one. It is 100% content fork, and arguably a POV one as well. I cannot believe it is being featured. Wikifan
02:32, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Merge. Definitely a content fork - the "background" in this article and the "aftermath" in the other mean they cover basically the same content, and the events cannot well be separated either. Also extremely likely (in this topic area) to become a POV fork. One query: what would the article be called? I don't think it's appropriate to treat Israel's retaliation merely as "aftermath," which we would be implying if we kept the current title of 2011 southern Israel attacks . Roscelese ( talk ⋅ contribs ) 03:38, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Lihaas's suggestion of "August 2011 Israel-Gaza attacks" seems good. Roscelese ( talk ⋅ contribs ) 03:45, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose merger. One side claims they're related, the other side claims they're not. Therefore per NPOV there is no reason to assume they are related. We simply mention that the Israeli government claims that they are related in both articles, which is sufficient to present their POV. Jim Sukwutput 05:54, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Support merger. Retaliation to an act of terrorism is not necessarily sufficient for an article of its own when it can be included in the Southern Israel attacks article as response. The air strikes clearly appear to be a response to what occurred near Eilat. This event would not have occurred otherwise.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 07:11, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose - just doing this for the record. My reasons are stated above in the discussion.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 08:44, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose - and would like to make a different suggestion: Imagine that this thing escalates into another round of Israeli-Gaza war. We then *should* one article on this "Nth Israeli-Gaza war", and one separate article on the the thing that started it all (the attack on the road). Just like we have separate articles for World War I and the Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria which was the reason/excuse for this war. But, importantly, we cannot call the second article the "August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids", because then where will we write about the Hamas's retaliation to those, and Israel's 2nd retaliation, and Hamas's 3rd retaliation, and so on and so on? I suggest calling the second article something like August 2011 Gaza-Israel clashes, with the term "clashes" perhaps replaced by something else which the media will call this. Nyh ( talk ) 12:44, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I agree with Nyh. I wouldn't be strongly opposed to a merge if this conflict escalates and the succeeding attacks become more significant (i.e. outright warfare). But right now I don't see any rationale for a merger. Jim Sukwutput
Support merged article (with perhaps a different title) - both the the attacks in Israel and the subsequent air raids in Gaza did not take place in a vacuum, they took place within the broader context of ongoing Palestinian/Israeli attack and retaliation, and for the reader to understand this broader context, both sub-events should be discussed together. Blueboar ( talk ) 20:31, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
But if we take your logic to the extreme, there should only be one article for the seven-decade long conflict. Obviously that'd be silly, so there must be a point where we choose to split up a topic into several articles, right? Jim Sukwutput 20:43, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Comment. Now that 2011 southern Israel attacks has been renamed 2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks , I think it makes the case for a merge into that article even stronger because that title can encompass both the original terrorist attacks and the Israeli air strike into Gaza rendering the point of this article relatively useless by itself. — Preceding unsigned comment added by 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 21:50, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Merge. For the reasons stated above. Brmull ( talk ) 02:06, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose and Rename to 2011 Gaza - Israel conflict. Merger would result a synthesis of two distinct events. The two are related but not a single campaign. Reliable sources are not saying this is a single event. This would immensely confuse the readers. The current name of the article is also confusing, since it appears to document a one-sided attack rather than bidirectional warfare. Marokwitz ( talk ) 14:13, 22 August 2011 (UTC)

Merge as to the reason that Israel always attacks Gaza after they fire rockets and this time is not really that different or special to deserve an article. ( NamflNamfl ) 02:08, 23 August 2011 (UTC) — Preceding unsigned comment added by 99.138.89.253 ( talk )
Comment - due to conflicting renaming proposal this merge proposal is relisted on the noticeboard and due to be discussed according to standard procedures. The conflicting renaming is frozen until the merge voting is closed. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 18:08, 23 August 2011 (UTC)
Huh? What is going on now?-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 00:13, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
You made a conflicting proposal of renaming, while this merging proposal had still been standing, thus your proposal was also disrupting and might even be irrelevant if the merge dicussion outcome is merge. However, if the merging discussion is closed with keep, then we would go back to your renamal proposal. The usual timewindow for each proposal is one week, though it might vary, depending on specific circumstances. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 16:57, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
10 say to merge (~59%). 7 say not to merge (~41%). Does this mean there will be a merge? Israguy ( talk ) 01:04, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
It doesn't really work that way. I/P can be rather partisan so evaluating a discussion based on oppose/supports alone is dubious. As of RIGHT NOW, the article has nothing unique to separate it from the 2011 attacks in southern israel. Literally, virtually everything here - including the infobox - is in the article. A pure fork, POV or not. So if there is anything of worth to merge, fine - but the article needs to be taken down soon. Wikifan
05:36, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
Support merge - Unnecessary content fork, current article does nothing but rehash information already specified in the other. The raids follow and are a direct result of the southern Israel attack, whatever one may feel about Israel's choice of target. Even criticism of Israel's choice of attacking Gaza would be out of place in an article that divorces the raids from the attack that preceded it, when the criticism is centered on the identity of the attackers. Poliocretes ( talk ) 10:50, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
I believe the reasoning for merge is solid and grounded in policy. Only a few sentences would be merged in that case, because the rest of the article is copy-paste from the original article. Wikifan

It's a fork of the original article. This is not an independent event, but part of the attacks on Israel prior. All the information here is already in the other article. That is the definition of a fork. Wikifan

Beware of synthesis[ edit ]
Unless we can find a set of reliable sources that agree that separate retaliatory responses by Israel due to separate attacks by Palestinian militants are an single event ("August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids" or similar), then this entire article is a violation of WP:SYNTH . In particular, it's highly doubtful that the earlier Israeli response to a Beer Sheva rocket and the current Israeli response to the Eilat attacks should be considered a single event. Doing so seems to be a transparently POV attempt to make it look like Israel is "attacking" Gaza. It's well known that Israel retaliates in direct response to terrorist (or "militant" or whatever) attacks coming from Palestinians, but each of these needs to be kept strictly separate unless there is clear evidence from reliable sources of linkage. In this case I doubt the Aug 14 rocketing/response has anything to do with the Eilat attacks, esp. as the scope of the Aug 18 Eilat attacks suggests far more time was require to plan this thing than the 4 days between Aug 14 and Aug 18.
I would suggest deleting/merging this article because of this. Benwing ( talk ) 02:38, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
This article was created in response to concerns about an "in the news" item on the Main Page. That news item said Hamas cancelled the de facto truce due to "attacks on Gaza." This article was created as a target for a wikilnk from "attacks on Gaza" to explain what attacks Hamas was talking about. After this article got started, someone asked for citations about air attacks on Gaza in August 2011 that preceded the August 18 incident. Perhaps "synthesis" arises from the article title's mentioning August 2011. I agree the article should report Israel's claim that each air strike into Gaza was a response to a specific provocation. Sharktopus talk 03:27, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
this article shouldn't have been created to begin with. no articles should be created "in response" to other articles. it screams fork. Wikifan
Let's keep the discussion in one place, in this case Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates#.5BPosted.5D_Israel-Hamas_end_of_truce . Though it's a bit pointless as we already have overwhelming consensus, with only Wikifan dissenting. Jim Sukwutput 05:45, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I did not say this article was created "in response to another article." I said it was created in response to a Main Page problem with In the News. Just to give a bit more context, a few months ago ITN had a similar issue with an item about a frog previously thought extinct. ITN was pointing to an article about the frog in question. People complained the article was substandard; the ITN item vanished from the front page, the frog article was improved, the ITN item linking to it was reinstated. There is currently an item at ITN that originally said it was about "attacks on Gaza" but that linked to a (substandard) article about attacks on Israel. Now the ITN item links to both articles. Ultimately, the two articles will probably merge into a single article which will sadly be about a series of attacks, revenge-attacks, revenge-for-revenge-attacks, etc. in the Middle East and involving Israel, Gaza, and Egypt. But as Jim S points out, that discussion will happen somewhere else. Sharktopus talk 11:36, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
The article, as currently reads, is biased to the side of Hamas. The article clearly uses tones and words such as "according to the Israeli government" "for which they blamed the Popular Resistance Committees, who denied involvement.[1]" ". That incident was said to be retaliation for a Palestinian rocket that landed in Beersheba." "some of the alleged 20 perpetrators." "Defense Minister Ehud Barak accused the Popular Resistance Committees" I suggest that the article be re-worded to a more neutral tone as soon as convient.

I agree with the bias claims - these strikes were in response to the attack on Israeli civilian buses and a private car. They were not the cause of the end of the ceasefire but a response to an attack in which 8 civilians were murdered. User:yoni_bhonker
According to Israel, these strikes were in response to the attacks near Eilat. According to Hamas, these strikes were the motivation for ending the truce. Both statements should be reported and attributed by the article. Sharktopus talk 23:08, 21 August 2011 (UTC)

Requested Move to August 2011 Gaza Strip air strikes[ edit ]
The following discussion is an archived discussion of a requested move . Please do not modify it. Subsequent comments should be made in a new section on the talk page. No further edits should be made to this section.
The move request to "August 2011 Gaza Strip air attacks" was postponed, since it interrupted the ongoing merge proposal discussion. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:04, 23 August 2011 (UTC)
the name of this article and proposed move references "raids/strikes" while the one focusing on the israeli side references attacks. Is this npov? 71.180.64.181 ( talk ) 07:44, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Not necessarily. A raid is an attack. Both sides see them as attacks. If 2011 Gaza Strip air attacks then I'd be willing to consider that a possibility for the article name. I'd argue that raid is potentially not NPOV as it is. If strike is also seen by others as not being NPOV compliant, I think attack would be best.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 07:47, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Italicized text added in edit for clarification-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 07:49, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I think it's not npov and it should be changed to "attacks" to match Israeli article. 71.180.64.181 ( talk ) 07:58, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I'm going to withdraw this and re-propose with your suggestion for the most NPOV option.
weak oppose per WP article "Air raid refers to an attack by aircraft against ground or sea targets. The term is generally used for strategic bombing, while airstrike is used for smaller-scale tactical attacks." Its not small scale its strategic and much larger than the pre-=aug 18 strikes that preceded it. Although were getting somewhere in the merge proposal above (perhaps) so we should consolidate this there.( Lihaas ( talk ) 11:25, 21 August 2011 (UTC)).
Support. Article is fork from 2011 Attacks on southern israel. If a conflict mutates from that article - then one can be created. But right now this article is 100% linked to the original attacks. No original content in this article, none at all. Wikifan
12:21, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Let me note that Wikifan is supporting a merger, not a rename. He means oppose here. Jim Sukwutput 12:57, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Jim, and if that rename is unsuccessful for what ever reason? The title is clear POV. Lihaas, if you take a look at strategic bombing or total war two concepts linked to air raid you will see air raid is not a NPOV title. Air raids have a very specific meaning in the historical context. Once again, I must state that I prefer merge before move, but given the fact this is a current event swift actions are needed to clear up present NPOV violations.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 20:00, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I don't have an opinion about the article's title. All I'm pointing out is that Wikifan12345 appears to be confused in that he's actually supporting a merger, not a rename. Not sure if I misunderstood his comment. Jim Sukwutput 20:40, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Nevermind, I didn't quite understand what you meant. I thought Wikifan was supporting a merge yes, but also a rename should the merge fail, but you are right that was not necessarily clear. I think the best way to understand would be for Wikifan to state whatever he feels.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 20:46, 21 August 2011 (UTC)

No concensus on this merge has been reached yet. Both the move and the merge are still being discussed. On a side not: I myself am in favour of a move. The article should be renamed as "August 2011 Gaza Strip attacks". Polozooza ( talk ) 22:06, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Polozooza is correct. In the event that consensus is not reached on the merge, this move is the best way to address NPOV for all sides. I once again must reiterate my difference of opinion with Polozooza however regarding the preferred solution as I feel that a merge to the now renamed 2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks remains the best option.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 22:14, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
"August 2011 Gaza Strip attacks" Why? What ref supports such a title? The title is almost identical to the militant attacks on Israel. No media source is portraying Israel's response to attacks on its own borders as equivalent to the attack on Israeli civilians days before. The article should be merged, all the content here is found in the original article. We don't create articles for military responses to attacks on the Taliban every time they blow up a military or civilian outpost unless its a specific operation. And consensus is not about votes, policy takes precedence and lest we forget this article was created without consensus. Wikifan

RfC on Accuracy of Using Term "Air Raids"[ edit ]
I'm requesting an RfC at both Politics and History on whether air raid is appropriate terminology given its connection to strategic bombing and total war whereas the Gaza strip attacks seem to be carefully targeted strikes based on evidence originally provided and referenced in this article.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 20:16, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Carefully targeted? Sure. Still, the resulted in the death of several civilians, among whom a child. The people killed in Eilat where also "carefully targeted" and the attacks "organised". So why not call it an attack aswell, like that article? Whether it be by land, water or air, an attack is an attack is an attack. Polozooza ( talk ) 20:56, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
I'm curious why the front page says "Israel responds to attacks in southern Israel with air strikes on the Gaza Strip." it was Israel who attacked Gaza first with airstrikes, which killed seven civilians one being a child. As we know, """Hamas was not responsible for the attack""", and therefore Israels attack was unprovoked. The front page should read "Gaza responds to airstrikes in Gaza with rocket fire directed at surrounding Israeli cities".
The front page headline is very misleading and I hope it is changed soon.
Here is the timeline of events:
12:00 pm August 18, 2011 A group of armed militants cross the southern Egyptian border into Israel near the city of Eilat.
12:40 pm August 18, 2011 The 3rd phase of the militants operation is commenced with rocket fire from Egypt.
13:30 pm August 18, 2011 Another attack on a Israeli convoy is staged on the Egyptian-Israeli border, killing 4 civilians.five.
hours after* Israeli soldiers clashed with the militants along the Egyptian-Israeli border, killing 5 Egyptian policemen.
Israel then launched retaliation air raids against the Hamas run Gaza Strip killing four plus a child.
With rocket fire in response to the airstrikes.
It's all in the link, from your very own:

You're reading the sources wrong. The attacks occurred on Thursday morning, Israel responded after subduing the original militants in a fire-fight. the child (age has said to be 2 or 12) was the son/daughter of a PRC militant. And as far as Israel is concerned, Hamas is responsible for governing Gaza and thus any attacks originating from it is the fault of Hamas. No international organization has disputed this, nor Has Hamas rejected their control over Gaza which they see as legitimate. Wikifan

Neutral. I don't see a significant difference between "attacks" and "raids". I do however support the merge.

Brmull ( talk ) 02:25, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Rename to "2011 Gaza - Israel conflict". This article is about a two sided conflict, not "air raids". Marokwitz ( talk ) 14:19, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Hmm, not a bad idea and neutral too. then we can merge both. Lihaas ( talk ) 20:36, 23 August 2011 (UTC)
Oppose rename as this has not been described as an all-out conflict or war. Recent news suggest Israeli government is about to enter an informal cease-fire with Hamas. Unless an actual operation takes place we can't call it a conflict any less than we can call the various spats in Afghanistan/Iraq unique "conflicts." Wikifan
00:13, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
Israeli government is not negotiating with Hamas. Hamas declared a cease-fire, but rockets are still being fired at Israeli cities and towns. Israeli schools and synagogues are destroyed. a 9 months old baby was hospitalized. If this is not an armed conflict - I don't know what IS. Israguy ( talk ) 01:10, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
Rename article name[ edit ]
The current name "August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids" is bias, since it is not clear from this name that the raid is a retaliation for murders of Israelis on Israeli land. Also - not only Gaza is under attack. Beer Sheva , Askelon , Ashdod , Sderot , Netivot and other southern towns of Israel are under attack - just not by "air raid", but "only" by rockets and missles launched from the ground. Name of article should be less bias and more neutral. Israguy ( talk ) 00:55, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
How is this not clear? The very first sentence mentions that the attacks were declared as "retaliation" by the Israeli state, with a helpful link to that article. Jim Sukwutput 08:05, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
Fully agree with you Israguy. We are not alone in this view.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 06:24, 26 August 2011 (UTC)
Copy-pasted from my section on this talk page: https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Talk:2011_southern_Israel_cross-border_attacks
Some parts of the article state the nationality of the attackers as Palestinian, based on sources which claim the attackers were members of the Popular Resistance Committees. This is a disputed fact, as the PRC denies involvement, and there are verifiable sources showing that: http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?ID=234512&R=R1
I have amended some parts of the article which state Palestinian nationality, based on claims of PRC membership, and it would be good to see more discussion about and critical analysis of sources which make these claims. Arfed ( talk ) 15:57, 25 August 2011 (UTC)

OK, but just let merge this article into the other one. Because this one is actually rubbish while the other one is on the event and updated.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 14:37, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Problem now. the same title with a capital s and lower case s links to the 2 different pages. Proper term is lower case s as its not a proper noun, but the content at capital s is better.
for gods sake what the heck is going on! Theres no consensus at all for this new incarnation since there were THREE attacks at various places. Lihaas ( talk ) 15:00, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Agree with Lihaas lets merge this article into the 2011 Southern Israel attacks article and move the name 2011 Ein Netafim attacks with it. Easy and best way of solving this.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 15:07, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
It appears that there is disagreement about the title and some confusion on how to solve the disagreement. Therefore, I am opening a discussion. Personally I feel that since there is no official name, and the location of the attacks is called Ein Netafim, the title 2011 Ein Netafim attacks should stay (there was another attack in the same location many years ago, if anyone's interested). If you dispute this, please discuss here. I am going to be out for the next few hours. — Ynhockey ( Talk ) 15:02, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

per below as well there was no consensus ont he move, thre were MULTIPLE attacks several km from each other. southern with a lower case is better. Lihaas ( talk ) 15:13, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
There were no consensus to move 2011 Southern Israel attacks article into this one.... but anyway its done. But I found the other article to be better.-- BabbaQ ( talk ) 15:10, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Because the article covers all three attacks, in my opinion it is better to change the name of the article to 2011 Southern Israel attacks . TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 15:20, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
We seem to have clear consensus on this one. Though may i add 2011 southern Israel attacks . I dont believe "Southern Israel" is a proper noun or official part of teh province or something, its the generic region. Lihaas ( talk ) 15:31, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

Regardless of the name, it was a waste of effort to maintain two different articles. The name can be settled later, I've redirected the other article here so that contributions don't go to waste on parallel articles. Poliocretes ( talk ) 16:44, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
No one is saying that we need to maintain two separate articles - apparently the two articles were created without their authors being aware that they have created duplicate articles.

I have moved the article to what appears to be the consensus version, even though I disagree with it—it's not as descriptive as the other title, while being the same length. In any case, let's tie up all the loose ends in the article because there were 3 simultaneous articles created and they were slowly merged, but some confusion still exists about the different ones. For now I'll go over all the redirects and see. — Ynhockey ( Talk ) 17:18, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
In my opinion, we need to find a better name in order to distinguish this specific event from the many frequent rocket attacks that have been fired by Palestinian militants at Israeli targets in the southern part of Israel during 2011. Any suggestions? TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 20:07, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
I think the 2 noms above are a little vague at the moment tille more details emerge 8(first) and pov/wta (second).
it seems both attacks occurred miles apart to say that they were at just 1 place of the border crossing is deceptive on the third attack. Eilat (which was the original name) seemed good to me, but more details from others emerged that it was outside eilat. Lihaas ( talk ) 20:41, 18 August 2011 (UTC)

2011 Ein Netafim attacks is not a bad suggestion at all, but in my opinion, 2011 coordinated guerrilla attacks in southern Israel or 2011 joint guerrilla attacks in southern Israel would work better because the attacks took place out in the wilderness nearby the highway and didn't occur in one specific spot/village/town. What is the most common name/s this event has received in the media? (please specify your sources). TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 21:50, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
But all attacks are not at Ein Netafim, and we dont even have a blue lijnk for it. Lihaas ( talk ) 22:02, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
As far as I know, all the attacks took place in that area. Do you have a more precise map of the attacks? (the current coordinates in the article seem wrong too). — Ynhockey ( Talk ) 23:04, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
I dont, thats why im asking. not sure what the wider Ein Netafim is. I thought it was generally Eilat. (nice airport, in the heart of the city though id say its quite unsecured. and that ol' russiahn plane parked off to look at ;) Nice swim though, but how does security work at the beach by the Jordan border? Missing 3 MOnkeys..;)) Lihaas ( talk ) 23:11, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
How about:
I don't understand why editors manage to remove whole sentences of information, merge unrelated content into ambiguous section titles, and then get away with it.
These kinds of heavy, unilateral edits require consensus. Also, this edit is not line with policy . The source explicitly describes the acts as "terror." It is not the viewpoint of the author, it comes from a reliable source. Guideline: "may express contentious opinion and are best avoided unless widely used by reliable sources to describe the subject, in which case use in-text attribution." Also, - not a policy. No shame in using the T word at 2011 Norway attacks so why can't it be used here?
This edit isn't even supported by the source. And this is SYNTH as the source does not mention the The Popular Resistance Committees nor does the source explicitly dispute claims that the perps were in fact PRC members. So again editors are inserting their own views in the article and it shows. I've already used up my 1 revert but I think Lihaas has made at least 6 in the last 24 hours which is sanctionable. Wikifan
22:01, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Oh for the love of god, inm not revertign anything. Im adding content and sources and explaining everything,. At any rate, also comment on CONTENT. the edit conflicts that i happen to overwrite and readded back (take for example the edit that updated 8 deaths, etc)
to explain the edits, the reorg of the section (which is NOT a revert of anything but an original edit) is in line organising content as per other attacks artickes when some sections are nothing but 1 line and unsourced at that. Look at the first link and youll see missing fact tags.
Swarm's edit is right (and it has nothign to do with me) as we dont copy word-for-word from sources, this is not a news service to parrot the media. WTA explicitly says not to use such controversial words unless in quotes. (for which those in the reactions that call it so are duly mentioned)
the original al jazeera page mentioned the soldiers on board heading to eilat, they must have changed the bit. often they change stuff keeping the sdame link. probs we can remove that then. It is in the source, i just read it. "soldiers on their way home from their respective bases for the weekend."
Per PRC see the next section (ill go and tag the source there, there was a jpost source that said so)
Done Lihaas ( talk ) 22:08, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Lihaas, adding content is one thing - removing content (and their sources) counts as a revert. Compare the first version to the second. ARBPIA is firm on 1rr per 24 hours to prevent issues like this from arising. Swarm's edit is disputable because the link he cites as a reason is a guideline, not a policy, and the guideline explicitly says go with what the sources say. Norway attack are described as terror in nature in the very first sentence. I encourage you self-revert and restore one of the earlier versions of the article. Wikifan
22:19, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
What content and sources did i remove? Tell me and ill more than happily avoid this sort of conflict by reverting my edit. I dont think a blanket revert of an entire version would help as it will remove a LOT of other stuff. But if you tell me what i rvted, i will surely self-rvt the controversy.
Norway attack sholdnt say that and ought to be changed. Lihaas ( talk ) 22:28, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Okay Lihaas, I'm going to be as brief and concise as possible.
this needs to go . None of the sources are suggesting a conflict of who is responsible for this attack. Just because a source doesn't mention a guilty party does not mean they oppose sources that previously stated the perps. Get it? It's call synthesis. Understand it. Breath it. Get it. I see this all the time on Israeli-related articles. Unless an RS says, specifically, "while x said these guys did it, y has yet to confirm said journalism blah blah." We as editors cannot ASSUME this , even if it might be true. Wikifan
23:32, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Firstly; refrain from NPA you comment on CONTENT "Understand it. Breath it. Get it." Secondly how is that a revert? what was reverted in adding a NEW section per WP:BOLD .
How is it then synthesis to cite EXACTLY WHAT IS IN THE SOURCES that security services pblamed PRC. Especially since the infoboxmentions it without a word of prose in the article. That is okay and not synthesis?
See Wikipedia:In_the_news/Candidates#Attack_in_Israel for more and more sources that OTHER editors too have said dont attribute claims. Lihaas ( talk ) 23:40, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
BE BOLD is something not to be used at I/P articles. Editors are limited 1 RR per 24 hours and are expected to gain a consensus or at least explain large removal or expansion of edits made unilaterally in discussion.
I'm looking at the sources, none of them cite a conflict between x source saying PRC is guilty but b source saying "no, that hasn't been confirmed yet."
I'll even post the sources for you.
Im nost sure if Clinton should come before or after the State Depts reaction. What do others think? is the minister or ministry more important? (which per Yes Minister is mostly civil servants who apparently know more)
Also to explain my reorg per a statement above: i tried to be more neutral in the reactions by saying "regional" instead of involved as we dont yet know for sure whos involved. Lihaas ( talk ) 22:25, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
Well in the US, the reaction of the actual Secretary is the most important. The rest of the State Dept is just beaurocrats meant to write her speeches, process passports, arrange meetings, etc. The US gov is more about the personalities that run the departments rather than the department themselves.

Unexplained and dubuious edit summary by an admin here. The addition was duly noted in the edit summary and explained, this is vandalism if there was one.
Added on the premiuse that its multiple attacks in a city by non-state actors and hence clearly similar, at least without consensus or explanation fo removal. Lihaas ( talk ) 23:51, 18 August 2011 (UTC)
I agree. Also, "don't be ridiculous" is rather offensive. Suggesting the event is somehow less tragic than the attacks on India. I'm not familiar with the "see also" policy. The only editor-related issue I have is the "don't be ridiculous" which is totally offensive. Wikifan
00:17, 19 August 2011 (UTC)
While the edit summary is not appropriate, the removal is hardly vandalism : "a deliberate attempt to compromise the integrity of Wikipedia". In addition, I think that the removal is justified unless a reliable source makes the connection; else, the claim that both events were "multiple attacks in a city by non-state actors and hence clearly similar" is an original conclusion . -- Black Falcon ( talk ) 19:42, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Is this article going to be part of a potentially greater conflict? three injured by rocket . It seems as though the original attacks have led to further engagements, yet all appear to be connected to the first attack. Suggestions? Wikifan
03:30, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
This is part of a conflict that has been ongoing for at minimum the past 70 years. There are reactions to reactions to reactions to reactions. So, I'd say let's be a bit conservative here in limiting the scope to what's actually relevant to the attack. I suggest cutting it off at "Israeli retaliation". -- Bob drobbs ( talk ) 18:15, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
This Jerusalem Post Article appear to conflict with this BBC News Article . The BBC Article reports the Egyptian policemen were shot by Israeli forces however it's not confirmed by Israel but they've starting an inquiry whereas an Israeli news station reports that Palestinian suicide bombers killed the Egyptian policemen. According to the BBC article Egypt claims they were shot by Israel however Israeli news says they were killed by Palestinians. I can't make sense of whether on not this is biased Israeli news or not. If I'm confusing two separate events then sorry and please correct me on this, I won't edit the article unless someone else will confirm these are the same event. Karlstar ( talk ) 16:28, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
You can't make sense of whether or not this is biased BBC news or not, either. Pedantrician ( talk ) 20:25, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Israeli news says that Israeli forces were shot upon, near the Israel-Egypt border. The Israeli forces shot back, towards the origin of the fire that was shot at them. It seems that the terrorists located themselves very close to an Egyptian post, and therefor Egyptian policemen were shot, when the Israeli force returened fire. But nothing is 100% confirmed yet. קולנואני ( talk ) 20:05, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
They now have their own article: August 2011 Gaza Attack . Makes things a lot easier, I'd say. It is these retaliations, after all, that resulted in Hamas calling off the truce. I would be very glad if some of the editors of this article would be willing to help expand the new article. Some of them have already contributed. Thanks already! Polozooza ( talk ) 20:11, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
I'm not sure this is a good idea. Israel was attacked by Palestinians. Israel retaliated, and after that - the Palestinians will also retaliate, which will cause Israel to retaliate again, and who knows when this will end. So, what's the point in spliting these articles? קולנואני ( talk ) 22:35, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
On it. But should have been in the sandbox before posting it on the mainspace. Not ready for wikipedia IMO. Also, I'd say its a fork and will eventually be deleted/merged - but not until thousands of readers see it. Sigh. Wikifan
23:29, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
Uh, Israel broke the ceasefire. It's amazing how many times you JIDF think Israel breaking a truce and then being counter-attacked makes the guys who retaliated to be "the ones who broke the truce". It's like Israel is some guy repeatedly punching some other guy in the face and then starts raging about getting revenge for that "unprovoked attack" when he finally punches back...but with an entire nation and nukes. It's pathetic and it's sad you JIDF even think anyone is buying it despite your desperate attempts to troll any responses away. 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 13:42, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane
In what sense is Hamas breaking a "defacto truce"--rocket attacks into Israel from the Gaza Strip have never ceased.

In the sense that some/most/all (not sure) of the rockets fired from Gaza to Israel were not fired by Hamas itself, but by other terror organizations. קולנואני ( talk ) 22:46, 20 August 2011 (UTC)
In the sense that Hamas and its apologists claim to be the elected government of Gaza, and expect to be granted legitimacy as such when dealing with the international community, they can't suddenly claim to be just one many terrorist gangs when it suits them. Pedantrician ( talk ) 20:00, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
How is that undue? There is nothing undue about including fatalities of those killed. There were no "corresponding" Palestinian victims, in the sense of Israelis being killed in cold-blood while Palestinians were killed as Israeli bombed militant targets in Gaza.
Plenty of other articles involve fatality lists. I suggest a self-revert, I'm not sure if I can restore it as I may have used up my 1rr in the last 24hrs. Wikifan
One killed in Beersheva by a Grad[ edit ]
Gaza terrorists bombarded cities in Israel's southern region Saturday night. One person was killed when a Grad rocket hit Be'er Sheva, and another two were critically wounded. Four others were wounded as well, and are in serious-to-moderate condition. [1]
Is "bombarded" the right word the use? They did not use bombs, but fired long range missles. Israguy ( talk ) 05:08, 21 August 2011 (UTC)

bombardedpast participle, past tense of bom·bard (Verb) 1. Attack (a place or person) continuously with bombs, shells, or other missiles: "the city was bombarded by federal forces"
Also, not to be a pedant, but aren't the Grads medium-range? The long-range ones are the ones that can hit Tel Aviv... :( Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie | Say Shalom! 12:45, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Moved section on 'Other Attacks'[ edit ]
It clearly belongs further down in the chronology. Placing it before the Israeli Air Strike section is misleading, as it would seem to suggest that it was also involved in precipitating those Israeli attacks. 174.91.156.71 ( talk ) 01:08, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
POV problem with Jerusalem Post as a source about these attacks[ edit ]
This article should be based on news sources that distinguish between partisan claims and established fact. Instead, a plurality of its references come from a single right-wing source, the Jerusalem Post . These Jerusalem Post references parrot the Israeli government claim (that the PRC was responsible for the attacks) as if it were established fact.
"... the Popular Resistance Committees, the organization who orchestrated the terror attacks near Eilat on Thursday that left eight people dead. " [2]
"...Israel’s response to the terror attacks from the Sinai Peninsula came swiftly Thursday evening when the Israel Air Force bombed the southern Gaza Strip, killing the leadership of the Popular Resistance Committee (PRC), who had orchestrated the attacks." [3]
We don't yet know who was responsible, and the PRC has denied being involved. Articles that claim otherwise are opinion pieces, not WP:RS news stories. Sharktopus talk 01:56, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Jerusalem Post is an RS. As it stands the article does not say the PRC is responsible, but quotes the views of the IDF, Hamas, PRC (denied), etc. It's not that we don't know who is responsible - it's that other news organizations are slower to respond. This is a regional event, so of course native sources will jump to conclusions faster as information arrives. And the Israeli gov. is just as reliable as the USA/Canada. US news routinely accepts the claims of NATO without challenge. Wikifan
02:28, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
The New York Times in a RS, but we do not treat opinion pieces in the NYT as reliable sources on matters of fact. I don't think Wikipedia should treat US/Canada/NATO/Israel claims as established fact when those claims are seriously disputed. Sharktopus talk 02:39, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Editorials are an entirely different matter. What op-ed concerns you? I don't see any cited here. Wikifan
08:35, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
The two JP items I linked to above, both with the byline of "Yaakov Katz," cross the line from news to opinion when they both claim as established fact that Eilat attacks were by the PRC. Sharktopus talk 11:03, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
No, they didn't "cross the line." Jerusalem Post is an RS, the sources you link are not editorials.
11:30, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Oh come now, JPost isn't right-wing, and definitely not right-wing to the point of not being an RS (that distinction belongs to Arutz Sheva ). Though, we could still broaden our sources. Western media is still reporting on this, as shown by the NY Times article I linked further down on the Talk, so we could use some of those. We could also use YNet and HaAretz as well. Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie | Say Shalom! 12:55, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Is there an ironclad definition somewhere on Wikipedia of what constitutes a RS? The definitions that I've found seem to make it situational: it depends on whether the editor du jour approves of what the source is saying.. If I were defining it, I would include such criteria as, does the source include both sides of the issue and quote opposing views fairly and accurately. By these criteria, Arutz Sheva passes the test. If it is disqualified simply because it is right wing (i.e., it reports on stories that the rest of the media would just as soon the public know nothing about), then of course it fails. But it beats me why CNN, which openly admitted that it was faking the news from Iraq to please Saddam Hussein, the BBC, whose Arab reporters in Gaza openly declare that they see their reportage as part of the Palestinian struggle against Israel, the New York Times, which displays photos of bloodied Jews on the front page but calls them Arabs, Reuters, who happily accept Photoshopped images until caught, or Ha'Aretz, which does not present anything but the left wing side of the issue, are all unquestioned RS. I believe even Al Jazeera is an RS, no? They obviously have a political agenda, but of course they aren't labeled classic right wing (and Arutz Sheva even quotes them fairly, by the way. Pedantrician ( talk ) 18:51, 23 August 2011 (UTC)
Doesn't it seem to you that an article based largely upon a single source is a problem? Especially when somebody points out at least a few cases where that source has conflated opinion with news, failing to identify disputed points? I may well be in error calling it right-wing, based on what I read in Jerusalem Post . Sharktopus talk 13:09, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
There are 80 sources cited which is very respectable, and JP is definitely not a "right wing" source. If you have POV or factual accuracy concerns about specific facts, we can discuss them individually. Marokwitz ( talk ) 13:40, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
At the time I first expressed this concern, the article had 57 references, a respectable number; more than 20 of those references went to articles in the J Post, which I thought was a problem. The article is much better now than it was a few days ago. I have identified a couple of problems with a couple of J Post articles in this thread, purely wrt their asserting as "fact" a disputed claim that the PRC was responsible for Eilat attacks. Maybe they were, but international media RS have not asserted that connection as a fact. Sharktopus talk 14:28, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Article Name Problem[ edit ]
There's a problem with the name as is. As I understand it, this article is about the series of 3 attacks which happened in immediate succession a few days ago. Is that right?
However, the article title makes it sound like it should include each and every attack in Southern Israel from all of 2011.
Does anyone have a suggestion for a better name? -- Bob drobbs ( talk ) 03:12, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
There is no need to change the name of this article. South Israel is under attack. The series of 3 attacks were only the beggining. Israguy ( talk ) 05:31, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Indeed, there are still rockets being fired into the South. It's even still being reported in the New York Times, amazingly enough. [4] O_O Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie | Say Shalom! 12:30, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
"(though Hamas had never actually ceased rocket attacks into Israel)"
On the surface this appears to be editorializing. Our very own article Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel itself indicates that such rocket attacks occurred between 2001 and 2009, suggesting that they in fact were significantly diminished. The article goes on to indicate that in 2010 and 2011 there were a number of rocket attacks, but much fewer than before. The editorial parenthetical appears to dismiss this nuance. -x
The relatively non-existant Hamas ceasefire that the article seems to quote appears to be Israelis unilateral ceasefire (link) . The article at the start of the so called ceasefire shows that Israel intended to take indefinite action but Hamas was only limiting it to a week. And while the attacks may have died down, they by no means stopped. Truce does not mean a reduction in violence, it means ceaseation. Just because the media used a word does not mean the definition is being used correctly, and just because the other article in question seems not to cover 2010 and 2011 does not mean that a ceasefire occurred. I'd argue that article is incomplete and out of date.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 07:06, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Hamas stopped firing rockets themselves, but certain factions like Islamic Jihad managed to fire between one and five rockets a month. There was even a two month period without rockets and Hamas said they were cracking down on the various factions within Gaza to make them stop (which they were apparently. Sir William Matthew Flinders Petrie | Say Shalom! 12:35, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Then I stand corrected.-- 98.112.224.106 ( talk ) 20:27, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
In which section should have include the part that mentions the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers?[ edit ]
Were the 5 Egyptian soldiers killed during the period of the original series of attacks (roughly between 12:00 - 18:00 pm) or were they killed after the original series of attacks? If they were killed during the initial series of attacks - we must move the part which covers the their death to the "The attacks" section instead of the "Israeli retaliation" section in which this section is currently in. TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 17:20, 21 August 2011 (UTC)
Since I'm already at 1RR, I have placed a POV tag on the article due to CuriousGnome's removal - or rather I should say selective removal, of Palestinian casualties from the infobox. I believe it is sophistry to pretend that this article and its accompanying infobox pertain only to the initial attack, when an entire section of the article is devoted to Israeli retaliations and rightly so. The fact that Gnome (and now Wikifan) have retained only the militant casualties from the Israeli airstrikes makes these edits all the more indefensible. I appeal to the editors in question to restore the full casualty figures. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:09, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Wait, don't mix my edits with CuriousGnome. I did not "retain" only militant casualties. However IMO the infobox should only include casualties from the original attacks. Any Palestinians militants/civilians killed later shouldn't be in the infobox. It confuses the reader. Wikifan
16:14, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Well then, could you at least remove the (+7 attackers) from the infobox? I still don't agree with the reasoning, but you (or gnome) can't have it both ways, either all the Palestinian casualties should be included or none. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:21, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Information regarding the Palestinians killed during the actual series of cross-border terror attacks and following battle which brought an end to the August 18th cross-border attacks is currently included in the infobox which covers the actual series of cross-border terror attacks and following battle which brought an end to the August 18th cross-border attacks (the infobox has been moved to the section of the article which covers this event to prevent confusion). This infobox should not contain additional information related to the subsequent events that took place in the following hours and/or days. If do you think that there are still errors in the information that appears in infobox, please state these errors in an objective and civil manner, and we will fix the infobox in order for it to reflect the reality objectively. TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 16:22, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
In my opinion, we can certainly consider, as a balanced approach, to add an additional infobox in the "Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip" section which would contain data relating to these subsequent events. What do you think of this compromise proposal? TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 16:28, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
It's better than nothing. We may have to address the larger issue at some stage however. BTW, I think your infobox casualty figures are out in any case, I count only six militants killed in the initial attacks, four by Israel and two by Egypt, but the infobox currently indicates a total of nine. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:30, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Too many infoboxes. Assuming the other article remains, explicit information about Palestinian deaths and a unique infobox should be moved there. I added an infobox to that article when it was first created but someone removed it. Wikifan
16:35, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
The other article should probably be merged with this one, they are obviously covering the same event. And "too many infoboxes" may not be ideal, but it's certainly a good deal better than a single infobox that covers only half the casualties. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:45, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
I'm not terribly happy with the fact that Gnome has employed a different infobox for the Israeli airstrikes, but as I indicated earlier, this seems to be a problem related to the limitations of the "civilian attack" infobox. We may have to take a closer look at that issue at some stage. Gatoclass ( talk ) 16:59, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
I agree with Gatoclass that an additional template is needed mainly due to the sensitivity of the subject and as a current more balanced approach. For this reason, and because in this current discussion this is the decision of the majority, I took the liberty of adding a new template to the "Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip" section (Gatoclass - if you now object to the use of this template I will remove it immediately). Nevertheless, in my opinion, in the distant future when we would be able to see the whole event and subsequent events in a better perspective, we can definitely considered, based on the decision of the majority in the discussion page of course, summarizing the "Israeli retaliation in the Gaza Strip" section and having the infobox appear only in the August 2011 Gaza Strip air raids article. TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 17:03, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
As I said CuriousGnome, I am not entirely happy with the infobox you added, but I think if you cleared the "partof" field it would be more acceptable. It looks very odd to me to have Israeli strikes categorized as "part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict" while the Palestinian attacks that preceded and followed are not so categorized. But as a compromise, if you would agree to clear the field in question, I could probably agree to removing the pov tag. Gatoclass ( talk ) 17:07, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
I've added the "Part of Israeli–Palestinian conflict" section to the infobox of the attack. Does this seem as an acceptable compromise to you? TheCuriousGnome ( talk ) 17:17, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
Okay, that seems reasonable. I've removed the POV tag. Gatoclass ( talk ) 17:50, 22 August 2011 (UTC)
The lead says that the perpetrators are assumed to be Palestinian while the infobox says flat out that they are. However, Egyptian authorities say that they have identified three of the people responsible and that at least one of them is based in Sinai (see here ). As such, I am removing the infobox line.
nableezy - 18:06, 23 August 2011 (UTC)
US/Israel say Palestinian militants, CNN says Palestinian militants . No one has suggested this attack was committed by some other people. Need a better source to support Egyptian claims. Wikifan
00:16, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
So, the US and Israel "say" but Egypt "claims", and an Egyptian newspaper is not a reliable source why exactly?
nableezy - 00:47, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
So, did you read my full edit? CNN says Palestinian militants, US intelligence and Israeli intelligence say Palestinian militants (all published in RS), a non-RS Egyptian newspaper doesn't say non-Palestinian, just "three men." More than a dozen were involved in the attacks, perhaps more who planned it. Wikifan
00:53, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
Wait a second, why is al-Masry al-Youm not a reliable source? It is a major news source in Egypt, you cant simply dismiss sources you dislike. The source says that one of them men is the head of a Sinai based "terrorist cell", not from Gaza.
nableezy - 01:19, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
I never said I didn't like it, I just assumed it was. And the infobox does not say Gaza Palestinian militants, just "Palestinian militants." Wikifan
01:27, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
You just assumed it was why? Because it isnt Israeli or American? The al-Masry al-Youm source contradicts the claim that they were Palestinian. You cant just accept the Israeli narrative as gospel truth and claim any Arab source must be unreliable.
nableezy - 15:52, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
And to alleviate your concern with using an Egyptian source, an Israeli one repeats the report al-Masry al-Youm and says three of the attackers were Egyptian. Though the article currently goes further than the source (Ill correct that shortly).
nableezy - 15:54, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
The "fatalities" section also refers to "Palestinian militants". I'm concerned about such statements. If no-one has taken responsibility for the attacks, then we can't be sure the attackers were Palestinian. They may, for example, have been indigenous Egyptians allied with AQ or another radical group. I think it would be appropriate if the article ceased to refer to the attackers as "Palestinian" as if their identity were known with certainty. Gatoclass ( talk ) 04:47, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
Gato, you know better than this. Wikipedia is all about verifiability. Everyone in this section are Palestinians. They attackers may been from mars, right now we just go with what sources say. CNN cite above lists Palestinian militants without citing Israel/Egypt/other sources, so either that is their own independent reportage or something else. Some say Gaza-based al qaeda affliate . No source has suggested any "indigenous Egyptians" of being complicit in this incident. Wikifan
05:02, 24 August 2011 (UTC)
Perhaps not, but since the identity of the attackers has yet to be confirmed, they could have been anyone, which is the point I am making. Gatoclass ( talk ) 09:45, 24 August 2011 (UTC)

How is news.xinhuanet.com a RS? It seems to me that the link provided is not for a news report, but to a personal colum. Israguy ( talk ) 01:16, 25 August 2011 (UTC)
Personal column? That's the furthest from the truth you can get. Xinhua is actually the official news agency of the People's Republic of China. They have a POV of course with respect to issues in China, but on international issues they tend to rely on international sources. They're fast and have the most detailed information, which is why they get used so frequently on recent events articles. As for reliability, the community has previously decided that Xinhua would be a RS regardless of content, unless specifically for contentious issues in China. Jim Sukwutput 22:23, 27 August 2011 (UTC)
Some parts of the article state the nationality of the attackers as Palestinian, based on sources which claim the attackers were members of the Popular Resistance Committees. This is a disputed fact, as the PRC denies involvement, and there are verifiable sources showing that: http://www.jpost.com/Defense/Article.aspx?ID=234512&R=R1
I have amended some parts of the article which state Palestinian nationality, based on claims of PRC membership, and it would be good to see more discussion about and critical analysis of sources which make these claims.
Someone cited this article, which casts doubts on PRC origin of militants: http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/doubts-emerge-over-identity-of-terrorists-who-carried-out-attack-in-israel-s-south-1.380525 Arfed ( talk ) 13:56, 26 August 2011 (UTC)
Ha'aretz: Rocket attacks on Friday, August 19[ edit ]
Hi. According to this news story from Ha'aretz, eight additional Israelis were killed by rocket attacks coming from Gaza on Friday (Aug. 19). The names mentioned are different from those in the article referring to the Thursday, August 18 victims, except for the Gaz and Karlinskis (yet those four fatalities were mentioned as occurring on the Thursday). Are additional references required to back up the claim of Friday fatalities? Thanks. ~ AH1  ( discuss !) 02:22, 26 August 2011 (UTC)
One Israeli person was killed by Grad rocket, the rest (other eight Israelis) had previously been killed in the cross-border attack. Greyshark09 ( talk ) 21:50, 29 August 2011 (UTC)

Despicable pictures of a DIFFERENT attack[ edit ]
I see Israel is out in full force trying to make itself look like the victim again. Even IF there is a legitimate argument for including the incident Israel claims began their murder of 5 Egyptian soldiers, the pictures have absolutely no place. It is a sub-section of an article unrelated to that sub-section, PICTURES of the cars attacked from a DIFFERENT incident have no place here. It's a clear, deliberate attempt to push a Pro-Israel justification POV. They must be deleted at once. 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 13:50, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane
Pictures are of the cross-border attack in question. I don't know what other attack you are talking about, you seem to have missed something. Poliocretes ( talk ) 13:58, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
No, they are not. They are of a seperate incident. Perhaps you should read next time, seeing as that sub-section mentions it in the heading. Explain how a bus being egged relates to this article on Israel's attack on egypt? 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 14:00, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane
Have you actually READ the article? The incident begun with an attack on Israel, which the photos depict. I will now reinstate the photos, and if you don't like it, feel free to report me. Poliocretes ( talk ) 14:10, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
Which is ALREADY COVERED. But nice try. Those photos relate in no way to this article. Just as pictures of every person killed being posted relates in no way to this article. If those pictures are in sources then they are represented to required amount. Desperately trying to display photos to garner sympathy for Israel in an article about Israel's attack on Egypt, when Egypt played no part in those bus attacks, is not allowed.
So, again, I point out to you that those pictures are not allowed to be posted. They are POV and POV relating to ANOTHER attack, not this articles head-line. That one incident caused another is already covered. Pointless information regarding the other attack has NO place in an article devoted to the attack on Egypt.
And I say again...present a reason why pictures of cars (which do not display anything in relation to the article other than pitiful shock value) and a BUS THAT HAS BEEN EGGED relate in ANY way to THIS article and incident? Pictures are reinstated and you will be reported if you continue to ignore Wikipedias rules. 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 14:15, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane
IP user, it is usually recommended to read the article before editing it. Marokwitz ( talk ) 14:17, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
IP, Egged is the name of the Israeli national bus company, it's not a bus that has been egged. You're completely out of your depth and better stop. Poliocretes ( talk ) 14:21, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
LOL. Marokwitz ( talk ) 14:25, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
Lol at the fact you think a buses company name is a reason for it to be included.
facepalm*
Pictures of a spood found near the site doesn't need its own picture either. Nor would it be allowed to post pictures of those Egyptians murdered by Israel. The latter being part of the direct subject of this article (Israel's attack that crossed into Egypt) and still not allowed. So no, a sub-section relating to a different incident isn't allowed to include pictures already covered in detail by multiple sources. Try again. 124.148.207.15 ( talk ) 14:32, 12 September 2011 (UTC) Sutter Cane
Please point out the wikipedia policy guidelines that support the above assertions. You seem to be suffering an extreme case of WP:IJUSTDONTLIKEIT . Oh, and what you're doing on WikiProject Egypt is called WP:CANVASSING , and accusing seasoned editors of being sock puppets is a sure way of getting blocked. Poliocretes ( talk ) 15:15, 12 September 2011 (UTC)
I think the infobox to be used should be "Template:Infobox military conflict" as during the latter part of the attack a firefight broke out between the Egyptians and Israelis and several Egyptian soldiers were killed. This was not a simple civilian attack. VR talk 04:48, 29 November 2011 (UTC)
This is
(a)denied by spokesmen for those committees in the lead itself. So we have two versions, the IDF's and the PRC's.
(b) The source for the line makes no such claim (note 2)
(c) googling rapidly, I see that several sources, one a blog though hosted by Tikkun Olam, assert that the IDF's own enquiry concluded no Gazans were involved.
Max Blumenthal says this has been disproved.
Edited Egyptian Protests section[ edit ]
The last line of the original text showed gloating from whoever put it in. Some evidence of this is the reference of the article for Million-man demonstration being an Egyptian news site, while the other about being only "a few hundred" is an Israeli one. If you want to edit it back to the original please reply to me here with your reasons & why I'm wrong. Thank you. StoneCold45 ( talk ) 17:58, 19 March 2013 (UTC)
I changed the sentence. "Instead" instead of "only" didn't make it or the grammar any better, Ajnem ( talk ) 07:47, 19 March 2013 (UTC)

What is QuickiWiki?
QuickiWiki takes the amazing Wikipedia content and presents it to users using the latest technologies.
Why?
Wikipedia is based on community contributions and financial donations.
The first part works amazing: people all over the world collaborating to create the world's largest encyclopedia.
The second part – well, it seems that people are not as cooperative when it comes to their wallets: Wikipedia's budget is very limited, resulting in a website that looks more like a private blog than the world's 6th largest site (I mean, images that open in a new page? Really?)
QuickiWiki allows people to access Wikipedia's content through a quicker and more modern interface, enhancing it with images, videos and more (How about being able to play the movie trailer from within the film's page?)
Hey! Aren't you stealing Wikipedia's work?
Quite the opposite. Wikimedia (the awesome people behind Wikipedia) have made all its content free and available to all humankind.
Actually, by using QuickiWiki you are reducing load from Wikipedia's servers and saving them money!
Cool idea. I'm in!
2011 southern Israel cross-border attacks
Site of the attacks
Deaths
6 Israeli civilians, 1 Israeli soldier, 1 Israeli Yamam policeman, 5 Egyptian soldiers, 10 attackers [2]
Non-fatal injuries
Perpetrators
Presumably 12 assailants. Israel has stated that the attacks were orchestrated by the Gaza based Popular Resistance Committees , who deny involvement. [4] Egyptian sources report that three of the attackers were Sinai-based Egyptians. [2] [5]
On August 18, 2011, a series of cross-border attacks with parallel attacks and mutual cover was carried out in southern Israel on Highway 12 near the Egyptian border by a squad of presumably 12 militants in four groups. [2] The attacks occurred after Israel's interior security service Shin Bet had warned of an attack by militants in the region and Israeli troops had been stationed in the area. [6] The militants first opened fire at an Egged No. 392 bus as it was traveling on Highway 12 in the Negev near Eilat . [3] [7] Several minutes later, a bomb was detonated next to an Israeli army patrol along Israel's border with Egypt. In a third attack, an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians. [8] Eight Israelis – six civilians, one Yamam special unit police sniper and one Golani Brigade soldier—were killed in the multiple-stage attack. [9] [10] The Israel Defense Forces reported eight attackers killed, and Egyptian security forces reported killing another two. [2]
Five Egyptian soldiers were also killed. According to Egypt, they were killed by Israeli security forces chasing militants across the Egyptian border, while an Israeli military officer initially said they were killed by a suicide bomber who had fled across the border into Egypt. [11] The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between Egypt and Israel and led to mass protests outside the Israeli embassy in Cairo. According to media reports, Egypt threatened to withdraw its ambassador to Israel, but Egypt's foreign minister later denied this. [2] Israel expressed regret over the deaths, and sent a letter of apology to Egypt. [12] The IDF was ordered to conduct a military probe of the incident, [13] [14] and on August 25, 2011, Israel agreed to a joint investigation with Egypt of the events. [15]
The identity of the attackers, three of whom were reportedly Egyptian, [16] is not widely agreed upon, [17] and so far no group took responsibility for the attacks. The Israeli government accused the Palestinian Popular Resistance Committees (PRC), a Gaza -based coalition of Palestinian militant groups, of orchestrating the attacks, [18] but the PRC denies involvement. [19] However, Israel attacked seven targets in the Gaza Strip immediately after the terror attacks in the Negev, killing five members of the PRC, including its leader. [20]
On August 21, 2011, an informal ceasefire was called by Israel and Hamas after days of escalating violence in which fifteen Palestinians were killed and many were wounded. More than 100 rockets and mortar shells were fired from Gaza into Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding more than a dozen. [21] The ceasefire was broken almost immediately by rocket fire from Gaza on southern Israel, followed by retaliatory Israeli airstrikes, killing at least seven Palestinians, among them two leaders of the Islamic Jihad . On August 26, 2011, Gaza militants called a second truce. [22] On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , Zuhir al-Qaisi , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks. [23]

Egypt–Israel border north of Eilat near where the attacks took place. Egypt is on the left, Israel on the right.
The southern part of Israeli Highway 12 runs adjacent to Israel's border with Egypt. It was the scene of previous shooting attacks in the 1990s.[ citation needed ] In the late 2000s, the Israeli government decided to build the Israel–Egypt barrier , although by 2011 only 10% of it had been completed, none close to the site of the attack. [24]
Following the 2011 Egyptian revolution militant organizations increased their activity in the Sinai Peninsula and Al-Qaeda militants groups were established, [25] after Egyptian police had all but completely withdrawn from the northern Sinai, dominated by Bedouin tribes. During the months preceding the cross-border attacks, Egypt reinforced its forces with about 1,000 additional soldiers in the Sinai Peninsula, with the consent of Israel, after a series of five bombings had disrupted the flow of natural gas to Israel. [26]
On July 30, militants staged an attack on an Egyptian police station in El-Arish, killing six. [27]
On August 2, a group claiming to be the Sinai wing of Al Qaeda declared its intention to create an Islamic caliphate in the Sinai. [28]
On August 14, 2011, Egyptian forces swept the Sinai Peninsula in search of terror cells. [29] Jordanian intelligence informed the Israelis that they had information about an impending terror attack in the south of Israel. [30] Two days prior to the attack, the Egyptian army captured four Islamist insurgents as they prepared to blow up a gas pipeline in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula. [31]
Israeli interior security service Shin Bet had warned of terrorist attacks being planned in the region in an area 80 kilometers long, presuming that they would take place at night. The warnings led to a massive deployment of IDF troops, [6] and the closing of Highway 12, which was reopened only on the day of the attack at the order of head of IDF's southern command Tal Russo . [32]
August 18 cross-border attacks and immediate Israeli response
The original attacks occurred in three coordinated stages. [8] They were carried out by 12 militants in four groups dispersed over an area 12 kilometers long. At least some of the attackers wore brown uniforms, similar to those used by the Egyptian Army . [2] Israeli military and police forces, in cooperation with Shin Bet , began pursuing the perpetrators immediately after the attacks commenced and locked down the area. [33]
The attacks commenced around 12:00 pm (UTC+2) near the Ein Netafim spring, on Highway 12 from Mitzpe Ramon to Eilat , when three militants spread out about 200 meters from one another, [10] armed with suicide bomb vests, grenades , RPGs , and machine guns opened fire on an Egged passenger bus on line 392, carrying mostly soldiers but also some civilians. [8] Seven passengers were wounded, most of them soldiers. [34] According to eyewitnesses, a white car was following the bus, and a group of people dressed in military uniforms got out and opened fire. The bus driver, Benny Belevsky, did not stop the bus and sped away, getting to an IDF post near the Netafim Border Crossing . [35]
The militants, dressed in brown uniforms resembling those of the Egyptian Army, then began attacking passing vehicles, waving white handkerchiefs to fool motorists. [2] One of the militants attacked a bus that drove by and detonated the suicide bomb belt he was wearing, killing himself and the bus driver, who had stopped the empty bus. [34] Another militant opened fire at a passing car and killed the female driver. The same militant then fired an RPG at an Israeli Air Force helicopter, but missed. An IDF jeep from the Golani Brigade then arrived at the scene and ran over the militant, killing him. [10] Another Golani Brigade jeep arrived, and ran over a roadside bomb. As the soldiers exited the damaged vehicle, the surviving militant opened fire at them. Soldiers and Yamam special police officers then located the militant and killed him in a gunbattle. Two other militants then opened fire at the from Egyptian territory. Israeli forces briefly crossed the border and killed both of the militants. One Israeli soldier was killed by friendly fire during the engagement and several soldiers were wounded. [36] [37] [38] [39] The Egyptian Army informed the IDF that its soldiers killed two more militants in the Sinai. [10]
In the third attack, which occurred around 12:35, mortar shells were fired at soldiers carrying out routine maintenance work at the security fence constructed along the border between Israel and Egypt. No one was hurt in the attack. [33] [40]
Around 13:30, not far from the first shooting incident, militants opened fire, including with an anti-tank missile , at a bus and private car on route 90, a desert road near the border with Jordan . According to medics, five people were killed in the attacks. [7] Seven people were wounded when another private vehicle was hit by an anti-tank missile. Eyewitnesses suggested that some of the attackers may have been wearing Egyptian Army uniforms. [41] Two IAF helicopters were called to the scene in order to evacuate those wounded.
IDF medic Anastasia Bagdalov was awarded military commendation for her response to the attack. She was a passenger on the bus that was attacked by militants. Begdlov used her bra as a tourniquet on a severely wounded passenger's artery.
Around 18:30, an Israeli patrol was fired on from the Egyptian border as it searched for militants. Israeli troops returned fire, and the shooting lasted for about an hour. A sniper from the Yamam special police unit was critically wounded and later died. News of the firefight interrupted a briefing by the Israeli Defense Minister Ehud Barak and Chief of Staff Benny Gantz . [42] [43] [44]
According to an Egyptian probe, Israeli troops entered the Sinai Peninsula chasing after the terrorists, exchanging fire with Egyptian police, and an Israeli helicopter fired two rockets at the terrorists and machine guns at Egyptian security personnel, killing an Egyptian officer and two policemen. [2] In a later incident, first reported as a suicide bomb attack, [45] another two Egyptian soldiers were killed, presumably also by Israeli forces. [2] Some Israeli sources claimed that an IDF investigation said that the IDF's attack helicopters avoided hitting the Egyptian military and that it remains unclear who fired the deadly shots. [46]
The five deaths triggered a diplomatic row between the two countries and lead to mass protests in Cairo outside the Israeli embassy. [47]
Following the attack, all roads to and from Eilat were sealed off and operations at Ovda Airport were suspended. Roadblocks were set up at the entrance to the city of Eilat, and the area was locked down. Magen David Adom (Israel's national emergency medical, disaster, ambulance and blood bank service) raised its alert level and began preparing teams of paramedics and medical equipment. The Israeli Air Force sent in Eilat police deployed a large number of security forces and a police war room was opened at the Yoseftal Medical Center . Seven of the 29 injured people who were brought to the Yoseftal Medical Center were later transferred to Soroka Medical Center in Beersheba . [30] The police asked the public to expect roadblocks at the entrance to Eilat amidst a heavy police presence in the city; however later in the day they added that no security incidents were under way in either Eilat or Beersheba despite calling for public vigilance and for the public-at-large to contact police in case of any suspicious individuals or items.

Responsibility
According to SITE a group calling itself Ansar Jerusalem claimed responsibility for the attack. [61] Nevertheless, Israel stated that it possesses evidence that indicate that the attacks were orchestrated by the Popular Resistance Committees (PRC) in Gaza. [7] [62]
The (PRC) denied any involvement in the attack, though they praised it. According to PRC spokesman, "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems ". [63] According to Haaretz, there is doubt in Gaza, that members of the Popular Resistance Committees were behind the attack. The Egyptian daily Al-Masry Al-Youm reported that Egyptian security forces identified three of those responsible for the attack as Egyptians. [64]
Hamas, which governs Gaza, also denied involvement. [65] Sky News quoted Hamas spokesman Taher al-Nunu as saying: "The Palestinian government denies the accusations made by Barak about the operation in Eilat and affirms that there is no relation between the Gaza Strip and what happened near Eilat." [66] Hamas did, however, "praise" the attack. [67]
The Washington Times reported that US intelligence agencies linked Al Qaeda to the attack, claiming that either the PRC or the Gaza-based Jaish al Islam carried out the attacks. [68]
Subsequent events
Casualties and losses None 14 Palestinians killed including at least 6 senior PRC militants; "scores" injured [69] [70]
At 18.00 the Israeli Air Force , [71] working with Shin Bet , [7] bombed a building used by Popular Resistance Committees' members in Rafah . Five PRC members were killed. Among the dead was the PRC's commander Kamal al-Nairab and military chief Immad Hammad, [72] [73] [74] who was suspected by Shin Bet of having planned the attacks. Of the remaining three, two were top members. [7] The two-year-old son of one of the militants, who was in the building when it was attacked, was also killed. [72] The airstrike occurred in the southern Gaza Strip, close to the Egyptian border. [75] [76] The PRC responded to the attack in saying that it vows "double" revenge. [7] Later, the Israeli Air Force launched a wave of attacks against targets in Gaza. A home near the former Palestinian intelligence headquarters was hit, reportedly killing one and wounding seventeen, and starting a large fire in the area. Israeli aircraft fired three missiles at a building used by Hamas security forces, and bombed a Hamas outpost in Khan Yunis . A missile was also fired at an open area in the southern Gaza Strip. Several targets were bombed in the northern Gaza Strip, including a building used by the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades . Several targets were hit around the Philadelphi Route , believed to have been smuggling tunnels. [77] Numerous rocket-launching cells were attacked during the airstrikes. Three Palestinian militants were killed as they participated in the firing of rockets, and senior PRC member Samed Abdul Mu'ty Abed was killed while riding a motorcycle in northern Gaza. Another man was injured in the attack that killed Abed. [21] [78] [79]
The Israeli Air Force bombed two tunnels and one warehouse used for manufacturing weapons in southern Gaza and one site used for militant activities. The tunnels had been used to allow assailants to infiltrate Israel and carry out attacks according to a statement released by the IDF Spokesperson's Unit . The IAF identified direct hits, and all aircraft returned to Israel safely. [80] An airstrike in central Gaza targeting a car killed a Palestinian militant, his five-year-old son, and his brother. [73] [81]
On March 9, 2012, Israel Air Force, in a strike on Palestinian targets in Gaza, killed Zuhir al-Qaisi , the secretary-general of the Popular Resistance Committees , whom Israel considers as "one of the masterminds" of the August 18, 2011 attacks, and his collaborator, Mahmoud Hanani. [23]
Palestinian militant response to Israeli air strikes
After the Israeli Air Force attacked targets in the Gaza Strip, at least 10 rockets were fired into southern Israel, hitting the cities of Ashkelon and Beersheba , causing no injuries. [82] Two additional rockets landed in a courtyard of a Yeshiva in Ashdod , wounding 10 people and lightly damaging the buildings. [83] [84] The Abdullah Azzam Shaheed Brigade , a radical Islamic group affiliated with Al Qaeda , claimed responsibility for the attack. [85]
August 21st rocket attacks
Perpetrators
Over 80 rockets launched from Gaza hit cities in Israel, killing one Israeli and wounding over a dozen. [88] Seven rockets were fired almost simultaneously at Beersheba . The Iron Dome rocket defense system intercepted five of them, but one hit a residential area and killed Israeli Yossi Shushan. The Lachish subdistrict was hit by 28 rockets and the Negev subdistrict was hit by nine rockets. Four Israelis from the Bnei Shimon Regional Council were injured while running for shelter in Beersheba. Three Palestinians working in Israel were injured by Grad rockets after they exploded in a field in southern Ashdod . Vehicles and homes were damaged by rockets in Israeli cities near Gaza. [89] [90]
A Grad rocket exploded near the coastal city of Ashkelon in the night, though no injuries or damage were reported. It was unknown whether the rocket was intercepted by the Iron Dome , though it was confirmed that a second rocket was intercepted. [91] On August 21, an additional 12 rockets were fired at Israel. Three were intercepted by the Iron Dome in Ashkelon. One of the rockets hit an empty high school building in Beersheba. No one was in the school because "the city had canceled educational activities in light of the missile attacks that Palestinians in Gaza have been launching against the south in the last few days" according to Beersheba deputy mayor Heftziba Zohar. Later that night, a rocket killed a dog. [92] [93] [94]
Barrages of rockets were fired at Beersheba and Ashkelon. Half of them were intercepted by the Iron Dome . Mortar shells fired at farmland in the Eshkol Regional Council contained phosphorus , which is designed to create a more intense fire after detonation. [95] 40 rockets were fired on Sunday. [96] Several structures were damaged and a car caught fire after two rockets were fired at Ashkelon. A three-month-old infant was injured by glass splinters. [97]
A 13-year-old Palestinian boy, Mahmoud Abu Samra, was killed during the rocket attacks when a Palestinian Grad rocket fell short and landed in Gaza. [81]
An informal ceasefire was agreed upon between Israel and Hamas after the Arab League held an "urgent meeting" in Cairo on August 21, 2011. [98] Some 20 minutes after the ceasefire came into effect, a barrage of Qassam rockets and mortar shells was fired at Israel. The Iron Dome intercepted two rockets fired at Ashkelon. The Israeli Air Force attacked a militant cell in the northern Gaza Strip, wounding several people. The Islamic Jihad Movement and the Popular Resistance Committees said that they would not accept a ceasefire. [99]
On August 23, four Qassam rockets were fired at Israel in breach of the ceasefire. The rockets landed in open areas and caused no casualties, but one caused a brushfire which spread to an area near two civilian communities and threatened local greenhouses . Firefighters managed to contain the blaze before it did any damage. [100]
On August 24, more than 20 rockets were fired at Israeli communities. Grad rockets targeted the cities of Beersheba, Ashkelon, and Ofakim , injuring a nine-month-old baby. In Gaza, a senior Islamic Jihad member who funded the cross-border attacks was killed and two others wounded in an Israeli airstrike on a car. Israeli jets also fired at two militants after they were seen preparing to fire rockets. Several hours after the strike, two mortar shells landed in the western Negev, causing no casualties. [101] Seven rockets were fired at Southern Israel, causing no damage or casualties. The Israeli Air Force attacked an Islamic Jihad rocket-launching cell, killing one militant. According to Palestinian media, the IDF fired shells at a militant squad in eastern Gaza after a rocket attack, but the cell escaped the strike. [102] On August 25, the Islamic Jihad Movement announced that it would abide by the ceasefire. The same day, 15 rockets and mortar shells hit Southern Israel, hitting open areas near Ashkelon and in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council . A mortar shell heavily damaged the Erez Crossing Terminal . Israel responded with airstrikes on several targets in the Gaza Strip. The two Islamic Jihad militants who had launched the mortar attack on the Erez Crossing were killed by an airstrike as traveled on their motorbike in northern Gaza. [103] On August 26, two Qassam rockets hit open areas in the Sha'ar HaNegev Regional Council , and a Grad rocket exploded near Ashkelon. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine claimed responsibility. [104]
Egyptian protests
On August 21, 2011, media reported that the Egyptian authorities were recalling the Egyptian ambassador in Israel in response to the killing of five Egyptian security officers by Israeli soldiers after the attacks near Eilat. [105] Egypt's foreign minister later stated that "at no point was there any intention on our part to recall our ambassador to Tel Aviv." [57]
Following the media reports about the killing of the Egyptian security officers, demonstrations against Israel erupted in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy. The demonstrators threw fire crackers at the building, unfurled a Palestinian flag, and called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador in response to the killings. [11] Eventually a young Egyptian, Ahmed Al-Shahhat, climbed to the roof of the apartment building which houses the Israeli Embassy and removed the Israeli flag, replacing it with an Egyptian flag he had carried with him, becoming an instant folk hero in Egypt. The Israeli flag he had taken down was burned by protesters. [106] During the demonstrations which continued for several days, thousands of protesters, shouting anti Israel slogans, called for the expulsion of the Israeli ambassador, the recalling of Egyptian ambassador to Israel, a review of the Camp David Accords and the opening of the border with the Gaza Strip. [26] [107] On Friday, August 26, 2011, a demonstration announced as "Million-man demonstration to expel the Israeli ambassador" took place in Cairo outside the Israeli Embassy, [108] drawing a few hundred protesters according to Haaretz . [109]
Israeli apology to Egypt
In October 2011, the New York Times reported that Israel had sent a letter of apology to Egypt for the killing of the Egyptian security officers by Israeli forces. [12]
Official reactions
Involved parties
 Israel:
President Shimon Peres said "The series of severe terror events are an attempt by terror organizations to murder innocent civilians within Israel, and to disrupt our lives" [110]
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated that this was a "serious incident in which Israeli citizens were hurt and the country's sovereignty was harmed." [111] [112]
Defense Minister Ehud Barak stated "this is a grave terrorist incident in a number of locations. The incident reflects the weakness of Egypt's hold over Sinai and the spread of terrorist elements." [113] He also blamed the attacks on Gazans and pledged that Israel will respond. "The source of the terror incidents is Gaza and we will act against them with all our strength and determination." [114] He also expressed regret over the deaths of the Egyptian soldiers and ordered the IDF to conduct a military probe of the incident, and defense officials said it would likely be a joint probe with the participation of the Egyptian military. [13]
Palestinian Authority Chief-negotiator Saeb Erekat stated "Israel stands warned of any possible aggressive action or collective punishment measures against the Palestinian population in Gaza." Erekat stated that the Palestinian Authority is "against violence in all its forms," however, he added that such attacks should not be used by Israel as "a pretext for aggression."
Hamas denied responsibility for the attacks but praised the attacks "...since they were against soldiers." [115] Hamas warned Israel not to attack the Gaza Strip, following a statement by Defense Minister Ehud Barak that the IDF would strike back at the terrorist infrastructure in Gaza following a deadly triple terror attack. Hamas evacuated its command centers and sent senior commanders into hiding in anticipation of an IDF response. [116]
Popular Resistance Committee (PRC) spokesperson praised the attacks but said his group does not take any responsibility for launching it: "The occupation wants to pin this operation on us in order to escape its own internal problems." [117]
Tawheed and Jihad , an al-Qaeda -linked group in the Gaza Strip, praised the attacks and said the "Jewish state should expect more." Over the internet, the group said "We in the Tawheed and Jihad group bless these blessed arms that pounded the fortifications of the vendetta-filled Jewish enemy in the so-called Eilat area in southern occupied Palestine." [118] [119]
Supranational
 United Nations – UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon on Thursday strongly condemned the attack but called for restraint. According to a UN statement, "the secretary-general hopes that the perpetrators are swiftly identified and brought to justice. He is concerned at the risk of escalation and calls for all to act with restraint." [121]
 European Union – EU Chief Catherine Ashton condemned the attacks, and said "I have learned with deep concern of the series of terrorist attacks that has taken place in Southern Israel today, including against civilian targets, and in which several Israelis are reported to have lost their lives and many more to have been injured. I condemn unreservedly all such acts of terror, extend my condolences to the families of those who lost their lives in these attacks and express my wishes for a full and speedy recovery to the injured." [122] [123]
The Middle East Quartet in a joint statement condemned the attacks and expressed concern "about the unsustainable situation in Gaza as well as the risk of escalation", and called for "restraint from all sides". [120]
International
 Bulgaria – The Bulgarian Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks, saying: "We express our sincere condolences to the relatives of all victims. We are convinced that violence and terrorism cannot bring peace to the Middle East. Such acts do not help the efforts of the international community to bring the participants in the Middle East peace process back to the negotiations table." [124]
 Canada – Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird condemned the attacks, saying: “Canada condemns in the strongest terms the terrorist attacks in southern Israel today. These cowardly attacks, particularly on civilian targets, are abhorrent and criminal. On behalf of all Canadians, I send my heartfelt condolences to those affected by today’s vicious attacks.” Furthermore, Baird said: "“Israel has a right to defend itself against such terrorist acts in conformity with international humanitarian law. Those responsible for these horrific attacks must be held accountable.” [125]
 Costa Rica – The Ministry of Foreign Relations published an article condemning the attack, communicating its condolences to the people of Israel, specially to the victims and families of the murdered. The article stated that Costa Rica, as a peace loving country, respectful of all human rights, expresses its most energetic disapproval of any kind of violence or terrorist attacks, regardless of the motives behind it. [126]
 Germany – Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle also condemned the attacks saying: "At this difficult hour we stand by the side of our Israeli friends. Those responsible must be prosecuted. Terror and violence must not be allowed to torpedo peace and negotiation efforts in the Middle East." [127]
 Italy – Italian Foreign Affairs Minister, Franco Frattini, condemned the "barbaric" attacks on southern Israel and warned the international community to prevent more such attacks due to the unrest in the Arab world. He said: "I would like to express my condolences and closeness to the Israeli people and government for the loss of life in the barbaric attacks today." [128]
 Netherlands – The Dutch Foreign Ministry condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms." [129]
 Norway – Norwegian foreign minister Jonas Gahr Støre "condemned in the strongest possible terms" the acts of terror, adding that Norway condemns all use of terror [130]
 United Kingdom – Minister for the Middle East Alistair Burt said that "I condemn these appalling and senseless acts of violence. As efforts for peace in the region continue, this brutality has no place, nor its perpetrators any excuse. My thoughts and prayers are with those killed and injured and I offer sincere condolences to their families and friends."
 USA – The State Department condemned the attacks "in the strongest terms," calling the attack "brutal and cowardly." Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said "We hope that those involved in the planning of these gruesome attacks will be brought to swift justice. We stand by Israel as our friend, partner, and ally – now and always." [131] She also added that "This violence only underscores our strong concerns about the security situation in the Sinai Peninsula. Recent commitments by the Egyptian government to address the security situation in the Sinai are important and we urge the Egyptian government to find a lasting resolution." [132]
 Russia – Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov spoke with Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman by telephone. Lavrov expressed his condolences over the terrorist attacks in southern Israel. He condemned this extremist act, and "reaffirmed the immutable position of Russia that there can be no justification for terror or for those who use it as means to achieve their ends". He also said that "despite the gravity of the crime, it is necessary to exercise restraint and to avoid retaliatory steps from which innocent people may suffer". [133]
Impact
Following the attacks on Highway 12, Israel is reportedly to soon allow Egypt to deploy thousands of troops in the Sinai Peninsula in violation of the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty, in which both countries agreed that the Sinai Peninsula will be a military-free zone. [15]
Investigation
According to Haaretz, the IDF General Staff's investigation into the attack “was a source of great frustration”. An intelligence alert from the Shin Bet had led to a massive deployment of IDF troops in the area, but the forces' alertness had eroded, allowing the militants to track the IDF and choose their infiltration route. The decision not to close the road on the morning of the attack in spite of warnings from the Shin Beth is characterised as “understandable error of judgment, and definitely not a manifestation of carelessness”, whereas the appearance of the defense minister and the chief of staff at the scene of the incident while terrorists were still in the area is considered a serious security blunder that nearly culminated in another disaster. [6]

2011 Dera Ghazi Khan bombings - Wikipedia, the free ... 3 April 2011 Dera Ghazi Khan bombing; Location: Dera Ghazi Khan District, Punjab, Pakistan: Coordinates Coordinates: Date: 3 April 2011 ... Location
‡ indicates attacks resulting in more than 100 deaths
Underline indicates the deadliest terrorist attack/s to date
Contents
The attack was a double suicide bombing that left more than 50 people dead, as well as 120 wounded. [1] The bombings occurred while thousands of devotees were gathered for the annual Urs celebrations at the shrine. Urs are an integral part of South Asian Muslim culture and are held to mark the death anniversary of a Sufi. At around 5 pm PST , a teenaged bomber detonated his explosives while devotees were performing a mystical devotional dance at the main entrance to the building. Many of those wounded were in a critical condition. Approximately fifteen minutes later, a second suicide bomber also struck at the staircase of the shrine. A witness reported: "Bodies were scattered all over and the injured people were crying for help." [1]
According to police officials, both the bombers tried to enter the shrine but being unsuccessful, blew themselves up on the entrance. A third suicide bomber was also recognized and arrested; [3] While people were running in panic, the bomber by chance ran into an elderly woman and a hand grenade dropped from his hand. [1] The woman signaled alarm and nearby security officials opened fire on him which left him wounded. The attempted suicide bomber was identified as Umar or "Fida Hussain", a teenager Afghan refugee hailing from the tribal areas in northwest Pakistan. [1] He writhed on the ground while people took away his equipment. [5]
Following the explosion, a state of emergency was declared and victims were shifted to various hospitals in Dera Ghazi Khan and nearby Multan . The death toll mounted as several people succumbed to their injuries in the various hospitals. [6]
It is said[ by whom? ] that the shrine had previously received threats from unknown militants. The Pakistani Taliban later claimed responsibility for the attacks. [2]
The shrine reopened the following day. [7]
Two days after the attack, the police claimed that it had identified the masterminds behind the bombing and that arrests were about to be carried out. According to investigators, the planning for the bombing had been carried out in the Bajaur Agency in the tribal areas along the Afghan border. [8] Two of the suicide bombers were from North Waziristan ; they had received their vests from handlers based in Dera Ismail Khan and later travelled to Dera Ghazi Khan, booking themselves a room at a hotel. [8] Umar, who failed to detonate his explosives, told interrogators that he had been told he would be granted paradise if he conducted the attack. He referred to himself as a " Fida'i " (meaning one who sacrifices their life for a cause), a term which militants often use for suicide bombers. When questioned how he would get into paradise by attacking people, he replied: "I don’t know about that but paradise must be better than this world." [8]
A statement from the office of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani condemned the blast, stating "such cowardly acts of terror clearly demonstrate that the culprits involved neither have any faith nor any belief in human values. Such violent acts only seem to be conspiracy to divide the society and create fear." [1]

Possible correction of Location and Coordinates[ edit ]
{{geodata-check}} Could someone please verify the correct location for this incident? The current Location may be confusing the "Dera Ghazi Khan" city with the district of the same name. And therefore the current Coordinates might be wrong as well.
The page's Reference no. 1 (The Express Tribune) writes "at the shrine, sited some 40 kilometres away from Dera Ghazi Khan city", and the page's reference no. 2 (telegraph.co.uk) writes "13th century Sufi saint Ahmed Sultan, popularly known as Sakhi Sarwar, in Dera Ghazi Khan district".
When I use Google Maps to search for the string "Sakhi Sarwar shrine in Dera Ghazi Khan, Punjab Province, Pakistan", I get 29°59′12″N 70°18′08″E﻿ / ﻿29.98656°N 70.30213°E﻿ / 29.98656; 70.30213 , which is also marked on Google Maps with an icon and title as "Sakhi Sarwar's shrine".
And finally, the page's reference no. 7 is a newspaper article apparently written by a journalist stationed at Dera Ghazi Khan city, but says of the incident that it took place "at Darbar Sakhi Sarwar, some 35 kilometres from here" -- and according to Google Maps, 35 kilometers is the distance from Dera Ghazi Khan city westwards to the Sakhi Sarwar shrine.
If my assumption is correct, then the problem is that the Location and Coordinates on the current version of the page seem to refer to the Dera Ghazi Khan city itself.
So, could someone please verify that this page should be corrected to the Location of "Sakhi Sarwar shrine in Dera Ghazi Khan _district_, Punjab Province, Pakistan" and the Coordinates of 29°59′12″N 70°18′08″E﻿ / ﻿29.98656°N 70.30213°E﻿ / 29.98656; 70.30213  ?
(By the way, if my assumption is correct, then there's another edit that should also be made in another page, i.e. the page for "Sakhi_Sarwar", section Incidents, which also points to the city itself -- with the phrase "In nearby Dera Ghazi Khan"...)
Done After reviewing your evidence and other evidence, I've concluded that your analysis is spot on. In addition to the points you've adduced, note that the entrance building of the shrine (clearly visible in the Bing aerial view), the coordinates of which I've used, appears to match the building shown in the photo in reference 7. I've made the necessary changes in both this article and Sakhi Sarwar . Deor ( talk ) 11:35, 6 November 2013 (UTC)

What is QuickiWiki?
QuickiWiki takes the amazing Wikipedia content and presents it to users using the latest technologies.
Why?
Wikipedia is based on community contributions and financial donations.
The first part works amazing: people all over the world collaborating to create the world's largest encyclopedia.
The second part – well, it seems that people are not as cooperative when it comes to their wallets: Wikipedia's budget is very limited, resulting in a website that looks more like a private blog than the world's 6th largest site (I mean, images that open in a new page? Really?)
QuickiWiki allows people to access Wikipedia's content through a quicker and more modern interface, enhancing it with images, videos and more (How about being able to play the movie trailer from within the film's page?)
Hey! Aren't you stealing Wikipedia's work?
Quite the opposite. Wikimedia (the awesome people behind Wikipedia) have made all its content free and available to all humankind.
Actually, by using QuickiWiki you are reducing load from Wikipedia's servers and saving them money!
Cool idea. I'm in!
2011 Dera Ghazi Khan bombings
Location
2 bombers, another one arrested [3]
A pair of bombings occurred on 3 April 2011 in a Sufi shrine dedicated to a 13th-century Sufi saint, Ahmed Sultan, located near the city of Dera Ghazi Khan in the southern region of Pakistan 's largest province, Punjab . [1]
Contents
Background
Sufism is a Muslim culture that has thrived in the Indian subcontinent and involves the belief that one can feel a linked connection with God through spirituality. In Pakistan, the Punjab region has been a historical hub of Sufi culture. Sufism and Sufi traditions are regarded as heretical by hard-line Islamists. In Sufi shrines devotees pray to saints while singing and dancing and this is considered un-Islamic by the Taliban . Several Sufi shrines in Pakistan have been targeted in the past by the Taliban. [4]
Attack
The attack was a double suicide bombing that left more than 50 people dead, as well as 120 wounded. [1] The bombings occurred while thousands of devotees were gathered for the annual Urs celebrations at the shrine. Urs are an integral part of South Asian Muslim culture and are held to mark the death anniversary of a Sufi. At around 5 pm PST , a teenaged bomber detonated his explosives while devotees were performing a mystical devotional dance at the main entrance to the building. Many of those wounded were in a critical condition. Approximately fifteen minutes later, a second suicide bomber also struck at the staircase of the shrine. A witness reported: "Bodies were scattered all over and the injured people were crying for help." [1]
According to police officials, both the bombers tried to enter the shrine but being unsuccessful, blew themselves up on the entrance. A third suicide bomber was also recognized and arrested; [3] While people were running in panic, the bomber by chance ran into an elderly woman and a hand grenade dropped from his hand. [1] The woman signaled alarm and nearby security officials opened fire on him which left him wounded. The attempted suicide bomber was identified as Umar or "Fida Hussain", a teenager Afghan refugee hailing from the tribal areas in northwest Pakistan. [1] He writhed on the ground while people took away his equipment. [5]
Aftermath
Following the explosion, a state of emergency was declared and victims were shifted to various hospitals in Dera Ghazi Khan and nearby Multan . The death toll mounted as several people succumbed to their injuries in the various hospitals. [6]
It is said[ by whom? ] that the shrine had previously received threats from unknown militants. The Pakistani Taliban later claimed responsibility for the attacks. [2]
The shrine reopened the following day. [7]
Investigations
Two days after the attack, the police claimed that it had identified the masterminds behind the bombing and that arrests were about to be carried out. According to investigators, the planning for the bombing had been carried out in the Bajaur Agency in the tribal areas along the Afghan border. [8] Two of the suicide bombers were from North Waziristan ; they had received their vests from handlers based in Dera Ismail Khan and later travelled to Dera Ghazi Khan, booking themselves a room at a hotel. [8] Umar, who failed to detonate his explosives, told interrogators that he had been told he would be granted paradise if he conducted the attack. He referred to himself as a " Fida'i " (meaning one who sacrifices their life for a cause), a term which militants often use for suicide bombers. When questioned how he would get into paradise by attacking people, he replied: "I don’t know about that but paradise must be better than this world." [8]
Response
A statement from the office of Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani condemned the blast, stating "such cowardly acts of terror clearly demonstrate that the culprits involved neither have any faith nor any belief in human values. Such violent acts only seem to be conspiracy to divide the society and create fear." [1]

The bombings happened at the Kacha Pukha camp, [4] set up for internally displaced persons that had fled the Orakzai tribal area in north-west Pakistan near the Afghanistan border. [3] The victims were among 300 people [5] queued to register for aid at the camp. [6] The suicide bombers were reported to be wearing burqas , [7] and having set off their bombs within minutes of each other. [6] Most of the victims were from Baramad Khel and Mani Khel tribes who had fled fighting in Orakzai Agency . [8]
The next day another suicide bomber attacked a police station in response to military operations in Kohat killing 7 and wounding 21. The police chief of Kohat, Dilawar Khan Bangash, said: "It was a suicide attack. The target was a police station. The bomber exploded his vehicle on the back side of the police station. These incidents are a reaction to the military operation in the tribal areas." [9]
In the aftermath of the bombings, the United Nations temporarily suspended operations assisting refugees in the Kohat region. [11] There are more than 200,000 internally displaced persons in the area of the incident. [12]
Pakistan's Defence Minister, Ahmad Mukhtar , called the attacks "highly barbaric and cowardly." [1]

May 2010 Kabul bombing
Contents
President Hamid Karzai had recently returned from a trip to US to gather support for his policy to promote peace and reconciliation in Afghanistan. A jirga was planned to discuss methods to promote peace with the tribal elders. Also a military offensive was being planned in the Kandahar Province . Shortly before this attack Taliban had announced 'Operation al-Fatah' that would target NATO forces, foreign diplomats, contractors and Afghan government. [3] Afghan police had set up several extra security checkpoints this year. In spite of these measures the bomber was able to drive his vehicle into the city. [1]
The bomber, driving a Toyota minivan packed with more than 1600 pounds of explosives, drove into a convoy of American military vehicles moving down the Dar-ul-Aman road at about 8 a.m. local time and exploded. [6] The blast created a deep crater in the road near the ruined Darul Aman Palace . [7] The bombing happened during the rush hour close to the National Assembly of Afghanistan . The blast destroyed 5 US military vehicles and 13 civilian vehicles. [8] Most of the dead were Afghan civilians including women and children in a public bus which was driving by when the explosion happened. [9] Five US soldiers were among the dead. The dead Canadian soldier was identified as Colonel Geoff Parker originally from Oakville, Ontario . He is the highest-ranked Canadian soldier killed in Afghanistan. [10] [2] An American colonel, 2 American lieutenant colonels and their 2 American drivers were also killed. [11] The American officers were identified as colonel John M. McHugh, 46, from New Jersey and lieutenant colonels, Paul R. Bartz, 43, of Waterloo, Wisconsin , and Thomas P. Belkofer, 44, of Perrysburg, Ohio . [4]
The Taliban took responsibility for the attack. [7] They stated that they had sent a man named Nizamuddin to carry out the attack. Several analysts believe that the attack reflected Taliban opposition to the upcoming peace jirga proposed by President Hamid Karzai . [12] According to Afghanistan's spy agency the attack was allegedly carried out by Pakistan' spy agency Inter-Services Intelligence . Saeed Ansari a spokesman for National Directorate of Security, Afghanistan’s spy agency stated that 'All the explosions and terrorist attacks by these people were plotted from the other side of the border and most of the explosives and materials used for the attacks were brought from the other side to Afghanistan.' [11] According to US military intelligence officials Haqqani network based in Pakistan was also involved in the attack. [13]
The attack drew strong condemnation from Anders Fogh Rasmussen , the Secretary General of NATO . [2] Prime Minister Stephen Harper of Canada in a statement condemned the attack and mourned Parker calling him a "great Canadian who will be greatly missed by the Canadian Forces family and his community." [14]

The American consulate attack killed 8 people including 2 security service personnel. [6] However, no Americans were hurt in the attack. The perpetrators were armed with guns and grenades and two car bombs. The security barrier was damaged, while shells from rocket-propelled grenades and hand grenades were seen in the vicinity. Police said one of the car bombs exploded at a checkpoint 50 metres from the consulate, while the other 100 kg bomb went off close to the consulate gate. At least three blasts were reported before a firefight between security forces and the attackers followed. According to Pakistan police official Ghulam Hussain, "The target was certainly the American consulate but they didn't succeed in getting there...one of the suicide bombers blew himself up close to the gate. Police guarding the US consulate started retaliatory fire. More blasts took place. We have recovered unexploded material from four different points". [5] The US Consulate General said two Pakistani security guards employed by the Consulate General were among those killed in the attack. [2]
Hours earlier 44 people died in a suicide attack at a rally in the north-western town of Timergara , Lower Dir District , during a meeting of the Awami National Party (ANP), the ruling coalition in North West Frontier Province . Zahid Khan, an Awami National Party spokesperson, said his party were celebrating plans to change the name of the North West Frontier Province when a suspected suicide bomber detonated his explosives. [8] An official of the ruling ANP party, Hashim Khan Babar, told the media the attacks appeared to be in response to a major security operation which was launched in the Orakzai tribal region near Peshawar last week. [7]
Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan claimed responsibility for the attacks in a telephone release by Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan spokesman Azam Tariq, with the statement “We accept the attacks on the American consulate. This is revenge for drone attacks. We have already told you that we have 2,800 to 3,000 fedayeen (suicide bombers). We will carry out more such attacks. We will target any place where there are Americans” [2] The attack was revenge for Drone attacks in Pakistan . [9]
A BBC analyst said the Pakistani Taliban were apparently aiming for a feat to match the one last December in Khost, Afghanistan , in which several American CIA officials were killed. [7]
An analyst in the capital said that after the government war on the Taliban the militants spread into more settled areas. He added that "The American consulate is one of the most well guarded places in Peshawar. It [the attack] was well planned and they very confidently hit their target." Al Jazeera's correspondent also noted that "Although they have been driven out of their strongholds in key areas, there is a feeling that a substantial number of those people have now infiltrated into the settled areas. There is trouble in the southern parts of the Punjab - so you do see some sort of regrouping attempt and a fear that there maybe an escalation of this sort of violence." [8]
The United States embassy in Pakistan released a statement condemning the attack and saying that it reflected the "terrorists' desperation". [10] Robert Gibbs, the White House spokesmen, added: "We strongly condemn the violence and the actions. And I would point out that ... extremists in Pakistan have succeeded in killing Pakistanis, which I think hardens the view that has led to gains that have been made over the course of the year against extremism by native Pakistanis." [8]

Pakistan which has a mostly Sunni population has seen sectarian attacks against minorities including Shias who account for about 20% of Pakistan's population. It is estimated that 4000 people have been killed in religious violence over the last decade. [6] This was the third attack against Lahore's minority communities in 2010: in May two mosques were attacked belonging to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community , and in July the Sufi community came under attack . While the government of Pakistan has banned several militant groups many of them have re emerged under different names and critics say that governments reluctance to act against them is encouraging them. [7]
These were the first major attacks in Pakistan since the country was devastated by 2010 Pakistan floods . [6]
The blasts targeted a procession by about 35,000 Shia to mark the death anniversary of Ali whom they consider to be their first Imam . [3] The three blasts occurred within 2,000 feet (610 m) of each other. [8] The first explosion happened in the Karbala Gamay Shah area at 6:50 pm local time. This was followed by a second explosion about 25 minutes later in Bhati chowk . The third blast happened in Anarkali Bazaar about 10 minutes after the second explosion. [5] Bodies of three suicide bombers have been recovered according to government sources. [3]
Two days later the death toll rose to 38.
After the blasts angry mobs attacked police stations and burnt vehicles leading to deployment of Pakistan Rangers to maintain law and order. [5] After the attack the authorities urged people not to hold outdoor religious meetings. [7]
Three days of mourning was ordered by the provincial government and all private and public institutions were closed. [5] The attacks were condemned by Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani who vowed to bring the perpetrators to justice. [3] The Chief Minister of Punjab Shahbaz Sharif announced compensation of Rs 500,000 for those killed and Rs 75,000 for the injured. [10]
Following another attack in Quetta 2 days later, Interior Minister Rehman Malik told the press that militants want to fan the flames of sectarianism in an effort to destabilise the government followinga series of military offensives against them. He also claimed that Punjabi, such as Lashkar-e-Jhangvi, and al-Qaida and the Tehrik-e-Taliban are one and the same. [11]

Pakistan, which has a mostly Sunni population, has seen sectarian attacks against minorities including Shias, who account for about 35–40% of Pakistan's population, and are the followers of the Prophet's progeny. [3] Two days prior to these attacks dozens of Shias were killed in a similar attack in Lahore . Sunni militant groups like Lashkar-e-Jhangvi and Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan which operate freely in Pakistan have for years targeted minorities including Shias.
On the day prior to this attack Pakistan's interior minister Rehman Malik had asked the Shia community not to hold large gatherings due to security concerns. [6]
The procession was to mark the Quds Day event staged every year by the Shia community to oppose Israel's occupation of Jerusalem . [7] The rally drew an estimated 2,500 participants, mostly Shiias. The size of the blast caused a stampede. [3] The explosion occurred in the Meezan chowk area of the town. The bomb exploded around 3:05 pm local time. It was estimated that the suicide bomber used about 15 kilograms of explosives. [8]
Lashkar-e-Jhangvi claimed responsibility for the attack and said a 22-year-old suicide bomber, Rashid Moaawia, carried out the attack. [8]
Following the blast, widespread protests erupted in the city with gunfire being heard across the city. Several shops were burnt by the protesters. [8] People were seen lying on the roads to avoid gunfire, while others set fire to vehicles and buildings to vent their anger. [7]
After the blast, police cordoned off the area and fired in the air to hold back people trying to search for their relatives. [3]
Thousands have attended a funeral in the Pakistani city of Quetta for victims of a suicide attack on a Shia Muslim procession.
The death toll from Friday's attack rose from 43 to 65 overnight as critically wounded people died in hospitals, police said on Saturday.
Shops and schools remained closed the following day. Security was also stepped up at mosques across Pakistan.
Thousands attended a funeral mass in Quetta. [9]
Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani condemned the attack and ordered an investigation. Interior Minister Rehman Malik told the press that militants want to fan the flames of sectarianism in an effort to destabilise the government following a series of military offensives against them.

Geo News Video Blast in Lahore - Youm Ali Procession
The death toll from a triple bombing at a Shia Muslim gathering in eastern Pakistani city of Lahore has risen to 37 after many passed away in various hospitals.
Earlier reports said at least 28 people were killed after three bombs went off in quick succession during a crowded mourning procession in the Karbala Gamay Shah district of Lahore on Wednesday.
Medics said on Thursday that at least nine people succumbed to their injuries overnight at hospitals across the city, a Press TV correspondent reported.
Nearly 300 have wounded as attacks sent shock waves through the district.
The attacks came as Shia Muslims were marking the martyrdom of the first Shia Imam, Ali Ibn-Abi Taleb (PBUH).
President Asif Ali Zardari has condemned the bombings as a cowardly act of terrorism.
The death toll is expected to rise as some of the injured are said to be in critical condition.
Lahore has seen several bomb attacks over the past couple of years.
Pro-Taliban groups have launched a violent campaign against Shia Muslims, and they are stretching the terror campaign toward the so-called stable areas of Pakistan as well.
Several Shia religious gatherings have been targeted in the central province of Punjab over the past few months.

Death of two journalists[ edit ]
Two journalists Asfandyar Abid Naveed (ca. 1976 – 11 June 2011), also reported as Asfandyar Khan, a career journalist working for Akhbar-e-Khyber, [6] [7] and Shafiullah Khan (ca. 1983 – 17 June 2011), of The News , were killed as a result of covering the double suicide bombing in Peshawar. [8] [9] [10] [11] Naveed died at the scene from the second blast. His death in the attack prompted calls among Pakistan's professional journalism organisations for more attention to be placed on the safety of journalists and for more action by police. [7] [11]
Shafiullah Khan was a trainee reporter for the daily The News (Pakistan). [12] [9] He was from Palangzai village, North Waziristan . Khan had recently completed a Master's degree in journalism from Gomal University in Dera Ismail Khan . He had been working as a trainee for one week in Peshawar bureau of The News before the deadly bombings, according to the Khyber Union of Journalists, an affiliate of the Pakistan Federal Union of Journalists (PFUJ). Khan received third degree burns after the second blast was set off after military and media arrived. Khan was transferred to the Khyber Teaching Hospital's (KTH) burn unit. Doctors said he also received metal shrapnel in his right shoulder. A week later, 17 June 2011, Khan died in the burn treatment center in Wah Cantonment , a military center east of Islamabad . [9]
Just one month before this bombing, journalist Nasrullah Khan Afridi , of the Khyber News Agency, PTV News , Daily Mashriq , had been killed 10 May 2011, in the same Khyber Super Market as the other two journalists. [13] [14]
While the Taliban were suspected to have carried out the attack, the Pakistani Taliban spokesperson Ehsanullah Ehsan denied responsibility and blamed the attack on "foreign agents." "We did not carry out this attack in Peshawar. It is an attempt by foreign secret agencies who are doing it to malign us. We do not target innocent people. Our targets are very clear, we attack security forces, government and people who are siding with it." [5] In Pakistan, references made to 'foreign agencies' are well-circulated conspiracy theories and rumours that point to alleged CIA activities in Pakistan and the perception that covert American agents are carrying out an orchestrated campaign of terrorism in the country to destabilise it.[ citation needed ][ dubious – discuss ]
The Committee to Protect Journalists believe the attacks were politically motivated. The organisation listed both journalists' deaths as a result of a dangerous assignment. [7] [11] [15] [16]

Islamabad - The United States Embassy in Pakistan condemns Saturday night's terrorist bombings in Peshawar's Khyber Super Market.  We send our condolences to all affected by this attack.
This was a cruel and vicious attack deliberately designed to maim and kill innocent people.  No religion or legitimate political philosophy justifies the indiscriminate slaughter of innocents.  The terrorists who perpetrated this brutality are beyond the pale of civilization.
The United States is committed to working with the people and government of Pakistan in our common fight against violent extremism.

PESHAWAR:  Taliban on Sunday denied responsibility for twin bomb blasts that ripped through a crowded market in the northwestern city of Peshawar, killing 39 people and injuring dozens.
The attack, one of the deadliest in a series to hit Pakistan since US Navy SEALs killed Osama bin Laden in May, devastated the Khyber Super Market district which includes a hotel, shops and student accommodation.
The Taliban, who have vowed to carry out attacks to avenge the killing of bin Laden, denied any role in the bombing and said they target only the government and military.
“We did not carry out this attack in Peshawar. It is an attempt by foreign secret agencies who are doing it to malign us,” Tehreek-e-Taliban spokesman Ehsanullah Ehsan told AFP on phone.
“We do not target innocent people. Our targets are very clear, we attack security forces, government and people who are siding with it,” Ehsan said.

Midnight terror: At least 34 killed in Peshawar Cantt blasts
At least 34 people were killed and over 90 injured, among them television journalists and a senior police officer, when two blasts ripped through a marketplace in the garrison area of Peshawar just before midnight on Saturday.
“First a gas cylinder exploded at Lala Restaurant in Khyber Supermarket in Peshawar Cantt,” a witness told The Express Tribune. “People flocked to the site out of curiosity,” he added. “Minutes later, a huge blast rocked the market.”
SSP Operations Ejaz Khan corroborated the eyewitness’ account, saying it was a trap. “The cylinder was exploded to attract people to the site,” he added.
Khan said that the bomb was strapped to a motorcycle parked outside the ill-fated restaurant – a famous eatery of the city which is usually frequented by a large number of food-lovers. He said the explosive device weighed around 10 kilogrammes.
Capital City Police Officer Liaquat Ali Khan confirmed that at least 34 people were killed and over 90 wounded in the bombing. The casualties were ferried to different hospitals of the city, where a state of emergency was declared.
Medics at the Lady Reading Hospital told The Express Tribune that they have received 12 bodies and over 40 injured people – some of them in critical condition. The injured also include television journalists – among them Dunya TV Bureau chief Safiullah Gul – and SP Cantt Shafiullah Khan. However, doctors said their wounds are not life threatening.
Witnesses said that the restaurant and several adjoining shops were badly damaged in the explosion which also triggered a huge fire in the market. The explosion also caused a power outage in the area, and security and rescue officials were forced to work in the dark.
Khyber Supermarket is located in a high-security zone of Peshawar’s cantonment area.
The office of Khyber Agency’s political agent and a Pakistan Army residential colony are situated nearby.
The explosion took place exactly where a tribal journalist, Nasrullah Afridi, was killed in a targeted bomb blast last month.
Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa Information Minister Mian Iftikhar Hussain condemned the ‘cowardly terrorist attack’. Speaking to the media outside the LRH, he feared that the death toll could rise further.
Taliban militants have carried out a string of bombings and brazen gun attacks on civil and military targets to avenge the killing of al Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden.
Iftikhar Hussain called for bridging the trust deficit between all regional and international players to defeat terrorism.
The KP-K information minister added: “Pakistan, Afghanistan and the US-led coalition forces must abandon hypocritical policies if they want to defeat militancy.”

Reporting from Peshawar and Islamabad, Pakistan — A powerful suicide bomb ripped through a packed bakery in the Pakistani military town of Nowshera late Sunday, killing at least 18 people. The attack came just hours after an explosion in nearby Peshawar left six dead.
Scores of people were injured in the two bombings, officials and hospital staff said.
Turk Ali Shah, a police department spokesman in Nowshera, about 25 miles east of Peshawar, said many of the bodies were burned beyond recognition, complicating identification.
Army officers were among the dead, said local officials who requested anonymity, adding that the property belonged to the military.
The attacks came two days after Al Qaeda-linked militant leader Ilyas Kashmiri reportedly was killed by a U.S. drone attack in the Pakistani village of Ghwa Khwa. His followers had vowed retribution attacks, but there was no immediate claim of responsibility in either of Sunday's bombings.
Militants have stepped up attacks on Pakistani military targets lately, including last month's assault on the Mehran naval base in the southern port city of Karachi that left at least 10 security personnel dead.
Police official Fazal Maula told the Associated Press that the attacker in Nowshera was a young man who carried around 4 pounds of explosives.
Sohail Khan, a witness, said he saw charred bodies in the hospital, adding that a huge fire triggered by the blast had reduced the bakery and adjacent restaurant to ashes. "There was total chaos in the town, and the area is now without electricity," he said.
Earlier in the day, a bomb planted in a pickup truck exploded on the outskirts of Peshawar, killing six people. Police said the attacker parked the truck at a bazaar, and the explosion apparently was triggered by a timer.

Retirees Propel McCain to the Fundraising Finish Line ... ... Responsive Politics has found McCain leading Obama among retired ... McCain to the Fundraising Finish ... hotel operator Marriott and Wall Street ... by Massie Ritsch on September 3, 2008
As the Republican nominee prepares to shift to public financing, donors at law firms, investment companies and in real estate join retired individuals as his biggest donors
ST. PAUL — Preparing for a general election in which he cannot collect private donations, John McCain vaulted in front of Barack Obama in fundraising from one of the biggest groups of donors in American politics: the senior set. A new analysis of the Republican nominee’s summer fundraising by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics has found McCain leading Obama among retired donors almost two to one in June and July, $8.1 million to $4.5 million.
While Obama has raised more total money than McCain this summer, McCain has collected more from larger donors in 15 of the 25 biggest-giving industries since it became clear who his Democratic opponent in November would be. Individual donors working in real estate, securities and investment, insurance and the oil and gas industry, as well as doctors and other health professionals, all gave more money to McCain in June and July, as did donors in other industries. Obama led McCain among industries including lawyers, college professors and other educators , entertainment and the computer/Internet industry.
Retirees, though, have given more money to the two major parties’ presidential nominees than any industry this summer – a total of $12.6 million in June and July. (August fundraising reports are not due to the Federal Election Commission until Sept. 20.) In June and July, McCain collected 64 percent of retirees’ contributions disclosed to the FEC. Employees of one Florida retirement community, The Villages, even rank among McCain’s top donors since June.
“After a long period of lackluster fundraising, the McCain campaign seems to have taken advantage of the less cluttered Republican field in recent months and gone to some of the traditional wells of campaign finance,” said Sheila Krumholz, executive director of the Center for Responsive Politics. “John McCain’s strong financial support from seniors recently mirrors polls that show that he’s popular with that demographic.”
As a group, retirees have contributed at least $78.5 million to the presidential race as a whole—all candidates since January 2007—and Democrats have collected slightly more than Republicans since the election cycle began. Contributors listed as “retired” in FEC reports are assumed to be senior citizens, but independently wealthy individuals of all ages may label themselves as retired when making campaign contributions.
McCain soon faces a shift in the financing of his campaign. “The clock is ticking,” Krumholz said. “When Senator McCain accepts the Republican nomination on Thursday night, he must stop raising and spending private money and rely solely on public financing from taxpayers.”
Like Obama, McCain has relied on bundles of money collected from individuals who work together. McCain’s biggest donor in June and July, based on $77,150 in contributions from its employees, was Citadel Investment Group, a Chicago-based hedge fund run by one of his major fundraisers , Kenneth C. Griffin. Employees of a Chicago law firm, Sidley Austin, pitched in $69,200. (Obama, who met his wife at the firm while working there one summer, remains the preferred candidate of donors there , however.)
Other top contributors to McCain this summer include the accounting and consulting giant, PriceWaterhouseCoopers, which also operates a lobbying practice in Washington, hotel operator Marriott and Wall Street banks Morgan Stanley and Merrill Lynch. A law firm founded by Charles Keating , who symbolized how political influence contributed to the collapse of savings and loans in the 1980s, bundled at least $50,000 to McCain’s presidential campaign, almost all of it in July. McCain was among a group of senators known as “The Keating Five,” who collected more than $1 million in campaign contributions form Keating and helped him fend off government regulation of his S&L.
On its award-winning website, OpenSecrets.org , the Center’s presidential section analyzes the candidates’ fundraising reports through July. Last week, during the Democrats’ convention in Denver, the Center posted observations on Obama’s summer fundraising .

Obama's Acceptance Speech Hit Some High Notes, but His ... Obama's Acceptance Speech Hit Some High ... to watch the speech in my room at the Courtyard Marriott Cherry ... Obama, Barack 2008 presidential election The Democrats may be promising more than they can deliver.
+ More
Like Joseph P. Kennedy, who did not stay in Los Angeles to see his son deliver his acceptance speech in the Los Angeles Coliseum—the last time a Democratic nominee did so in a stadium (for a good account of that, see this excellent story in USA Today)—I decided to watch the speech on television rather than in the stadium.
Our reasons were different. Ambassador Kennedy (who was the same age in 1960 as John McCain is now) did not want to be spotlighted as the man who had bought the nomination for his son (which he was); I wanted to see how it played on television. Joseph Kennedy flew to New York and invited himself to watch the speech with Henry Luce, the proprietor of the then Republican-leaning Time and Life but who had a soft spot for Catholics (his wife, Clare Boothe Luce, was a Catholic convert), in his River House apartment in New York.
I chose, faute de mieux (as Jean-François Kerry would say), to watch the speech in my room at the Courtyard Marriott Cherry Creek (which is a couple of miles from the Saks/Neiman's shopping center and across the street from a "checks cashed" store).
First, a trivial point. The temple stage set at Invesco Field was obviously a knockoff of the Pergamon Altar in the quite wonderful Pergamon Museum in Berlin, put together by Middle East history academicians (when Germany had the best of them) in the early 20th century. Did Barack Obama have time in his visit to Berlin (when he didn't have time to fly to see the wounded American soldiers in Ramstein) to visit the Pergamon Museum? Just asking. It's something every cultured person should see. (By the way, why wasn't there any reference to individual investment accounts in a speech delivered in a stadium to which Invesco bought naming rights?)
Anyway, during most of the speech, the setting (as seen on NBC, ABC, and the local Fox affiliate; the Courtyard Marriott, to its shame, doesn't have Fox News on its cable menu) didn't seem too off-putting. What looked weird (and to Marc Ambinder in the stadium, too) was the fireworks erupting from each end of the Pergamon temple after Obama spoke. And the drop-off from the podium was off-putting for those of us who are scared of heights.
And Obama? This was not quite his speech at the 2004 Democratic National Convention, when, after all, he wasn't the Democratic presidential nominee. His delivery was not quite flawless, but that didn't matter. He seemed, to some conservative bloggers at least, to be angry, but he read off the teleprompter with great skill. (What if someone had blitzed the teleprompters? Bad thought.)
I thought it was, for most voters, a workmanlike rather than an inspirational speech. He started with the advantage that the mood of the country is negative—a big majority of us think the nation is seriously on the wrong track. He's going with the flow there.
But on the other main themes, of this speech and this Democratic National Convention, I'm not quite so sure he's on steady ground.
A fair part of the speech was devoted to the notion that John McCain is the (90 percent) same as George W. Bush. But that's pretty easy to refute. Temperamentally, on a variety of high-profile issues, McCain has been over many years at odds with Bush, and I don't think Obama's clever tropes are going to affect the public's impressions of this very much.
The second theme of Obama's speech, and that of the subsidiary speakers at the convention, was that middle-class Americans are suffering terribly (despite the revised economic figures that showed gross domestic product in the second quarter increasing not 1.9 percent but 3.3 percent). Obama went into something like a laundry list of how his administration would help everybody out.
Conservative commentators have noticed the tensions between the life stories of how the Obamas and the Bidens have lifted themselves by their own efforts and how people in similar situations now can only hope for advancement with additional government assistance. There's an obvious tension here: The safety net worked in the past, and we need more in the future. But I think there's an additional problem. How credible are the promises that everybody can go to college and get healthcare services without paying anything? Are Obama and the Democrats promising too much?
On energy, we heard some defensiveness. "Drilling is a stopgap measure, not a long-term solution. Not even close." The audience in the stadium loved this. But $4 gas has undermined this position hugely. Obama and the Democrats are playing defense here.
My bottom line is that the major themes of Obama's speech and—so far as he controlled it—the Democrats' themes may not be sustainable. McCain = Bush: There are too many instances (not all to conservatives' liking) to the contrary. Economic distress: But would raising taxes on high earners and raising protectionist walls alleviate it? Obama's campaign tried to insert more "granular" descriptions of what an Obama government (and Democratic Congress) would do. But are they credible?
And finally, Obama's attempt to rule out of bounds any suggestions that he is not "patriotic." Why should we ignore his 20-year association with his preacher (and inspiration for the title of his 2005 book), who proclaims, "God damn America!"? Why should we ignore his association with the unrepentant Weather Underground bomber terrorist William Ayers ? Obama and the mainstream media would like to sweep these things aside, but are they not important things about who he is?
It's nice to declare out of bounds any attacks that may hurt you. But why should it be considered fair?

Obama reacts to McCain's campaign's ... 20082/2008_presidential_election/michigan ... Heading into a lunch break, the Obama and Clinton camps are sparring over what is and isn't a concession in their sparring over Florida delegates. 
The Obama camp says it's making a concession when it agrees to allowing Florida half its delegate votes. That would give Clinton a net gain of 19 delegates, up from the zero delegates she gets under the current rules.
"An extraordinary concession," says Rep. Robert Wexler of Florida, an Obama man.
"A concession? Give me a break," counters Clinton man Harold Ickes in the hallway outside the party meeting.
He argues from the standpoint that Clinton has a net gain of 38 delegates in Florida. "Hillary Clinton loses delegates."
But Clinton doesn't have any Florida delegates now, let alone an edge of 38. Florida was stripped of all of its delegates.
Score it for Obama. Clinton can't lose delegates she doesn't have. 
Barack Obama will end the five-month primary campaign Tuesday night at the site where the Republican National Convention will be held.
He and his wife will hold a rally at the Xcel Energy Center in St. Paul, symbolic staging apparently meant to signal that Obama will take the battle to the Republicans should he be the Democratic nominee.
It's also a signal that he thinks he has the nomination wrapped up, turning his back on the two pirmary states that vote Tuesday, Montana and South Dakota, and focusing instead on Minnesota, a general election battlefield state.
Susie Buell of San Francisco voted for Hillary Clinton in the California primary. Her vote is counted, the delegates for Clinton guaranteed seats when the Democratic National Convention opens in Denver in August.
But she couldn't stay home when she heard the Democrats would debate whether to seat delegates from Florida and Michigan.
"We want every vote in America counted," Buell said, standing outside DC's Marriott Wardman Park hotel with hundreds of fellow protestors.
Amy Rao of Palo Alto likened it to what happened in 2000, when Democrats claim that Florida did not count all the votes for Al Gore and threw the election to George Bush.
"We will not let that happen again," Rao said.
Her California group all wore T shirts declaring, "We spoke loud and clear. Our voices must be heard."
Among other signs:
"Woman Arise. Stop the Bias!"
The Rules and Bylaws Committee of the Democratic National Committee starts its meeting at 930 am EDT.
Hundreds of people - most of them women and virtually all of them Hillary supporters - are protesting outside the hotel where the Democratic Party's Rules and Bylaws Committee will meet to decide the fate of convention delegates from Florida and Michigan.
""We voted. We want out votes counted," said Janet W. Larson, a Democrat from Jacksonville.
She was one of more than 100 Democrats from the Jacksonville area who rode two buses to Washington, arriivng about 1 am after a 12-hour ride. They're waving signs proclaiming, "We spoke loud and clear. Our voices must be heard."
She said she knew that Florida's primary violated party rules because it was too early. But she said Florida voters shouldn't be penalized.
"It's the politicians who did this," she said. "Not the voters."
May 30, 2008
Barack Obama is seizing on John McCain's assertion that U.S. troops are down to pre-surge levels in Iraq (McCain appears to have been off by about 20,000). The Obama campaign just sent out some of the prepared remarks Obama plans to deliver in Montana tonight.
In those remarks, Obama reacts to McCain's campaign's reaction that making issue of the troop discrepancy is "nitpicking," saying, "I don’t think tens of thousands of American troops amounts to nitpicking."
He also accuses McCain, in inviting Obama to travel to Iraq with him, of a political stunt and an effort to raise campaign dollars.
For good measure Obama also plans to throw in a reference to former White House press secretary Scott McClellan whose new book is critical of Bush. "Just this week, we were reminded by President Bush’s own former spokesman of how it was deception – not straight talk – that misled the American people into war. It’s time to cut through the tough talk so that we can be straight with the American people about a war that’s cost us thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars without making us safer."
Scott McClellan could be a Barack Obama supporter.
The former Bush press secretary, currently peddling his new book, which charges the White House engaged in a "propaganda" campaign to sell the Iraq war, told CBS and ABC that he was "intrigued by Sen. Obama's message."
And, he told CBS' Katie Couric, ""It's a message that is very similar to the one Gov. Bush ran on in 2000, and won on, promising to bring bi-partisanship and honesty and integrity to Washington."
Then there was this dialogue:
Couric: So you could see yourself actually voting for Barack Obama?
McClellan: I just said I haven't made a decision, but I do think, you know, (presumptive GOP nominee) McCain talked about ending the permanent campaign recently, Sen. Obama talks about changing the way Washington works. They better have a specific plan for doing that if they're gonna actually be the president of the United States, because it is difficult to do.
At the White House Friday, press secretary Dana Perino was asked about the possibility of her predecessor voting for the Democrat.
"I really don't care who he votes for," she said.
Supporters of Hillary Clinton are pushing hard the idea that she is the strongest Democrat against John McCain this fall. But it could be a tough argument to make in at least one of the two states in Saturday's spotlight.
The Democratic party's Rules and Bylaws Committee will meet to try to figure out how and whether to seat the Michigan and FLorida delegations. Latest polls show clearly that McCain handily beats Democratic frontrunner Barack Obama in Florida, but the outcome in Michigan is less clear.
Latest polls from Rasmussen and Quinnipiac surveys give McCain a sizeable lead over Obama in Florida, but Clinton beats the Republican.
In Michigan, though, Rasumussen has McCain and Clinton tied, while McCain beats Obama by 1.

Barack Obama's campaign released a letter from his longtime physician deeming him in "excellent health" and saying the on-again, off-again smoker has managed to give up cigarettes since launching his candidacy but was still using Nicorette gum to manage his cravings.
The letter from doctor David Scheiner, who has seen Obama for 21 years, follows Republican John McCain's release of his doctor's report declaring no recurrence of McCain's skin cancer from 2002. Scheiner said Obama's "family history is pertinent for his mother’s death from ovarian cancer and grandfather who died of prostate cancer," but that Obama "is in overall good physical and mental health needed to maintain the resiliency required in the Office of President."
While reporters enjoyed reading about the 71-year-old McCain's freckles on his backside, the best Obama's doctor shared was that the 46-year-old Obama sometimes gets upper respiratory infections and skin rashes.
As of his last full checkup in January 2007, Obama was running regularly, eating a balanced diet and had low or normal cholesterol and PSA levels, blood pressure of 90/60 and an athletic pulse of 60/minute.

Obama Heads To Michigan Next Week
Sen. Barack Obama (Ill.) will make a stop in Michigan next Monday, less than 48 hours after an expected ruling by the Democratic National Committee about the fate of the Wolverine State's delegation to the party convention in August.
Those familiar with Obama's schedule insist the trip is not designed as victory lap in anticipation of a favorable ruling this weekend at the DNC's Rules and Bylaws Committee meeting or an attempt to kick-start the Illinois senator's general election campaign in the state.
Still, the symbolic import of Obama stopping in Michigan soon after what may be the final ruling about the seating of the state's delegates should not be underestimated.
By traveling to the state for the second time in the last month (former Sen. John Edwards announced his endorsement of Obama in Grand Rapids in mid-May), Obama is sending a clear signal about the importance of Michigan in his general election calculus.
The last three Democratic nominees for president have carried Michigan -- Sen. John Kerry (Mass.) won it with 51 percent in 2004 -- but recent polling shows Obama in a dead heat with Sen. John McCain (Ariz.) in the state.
Democrats have privately fretted for months that the ongoing battle over the seating of delegates selected in the Michigan and Florida primaries could endanger their chances of winning the states in the fall.
A quick recap: Florida and Michigan moved their primaries too far forward in the nominating calendar, according to the DNC, which subsequently stripped both states of their delegates. As a result, none of the candidates actively campaigned in either state and Obama went so far as to remove his name from the ballot in Michigan.
Obama's trip last week to Florida -- he spent three days in the Sunshine State -- coupled with his planned visit to Michigan show he is seeking to assure voters in each of the two states that he believes both are essential to his path to the nomination and they he will cede neither one to McCain.
Republicans, on the other hand, are seeking to use the delegate imbroglio in Michigan and Florida to convince voters that Democrats have written them off. Told of Obama's trip next week, Michigan Republican Party Chairman Saul Anuzis said that the Illinois senator had "ignored" the state, adding: "He will have to do more than make the obligatory photo op stop here to explain his position on bashing the domestic auto industry."

SO LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT:
NOW the story is this: both the media AND McClellan knew the TRUTH all along, but they were not telling us
The ENTIRE problem was Bush was lying the whole time.
1) McClellan never "went along" with it for his own self-interest -
2) The New York Times never "went along" with the story by printing some stupid story about aluminum tubes
3) The press knew the truth all along, but somehow the administration was such a good liar that the press was helpless
4) The democrats "went along" with the war when it was in their own self-interest in the 2002 and 2004 elections
5) The democrats "went along" with the war by FUNDING it for years and years because a few people in the Bush administration were such good liars.
Is that their story now???
My comment is this: all these people let down the American public - they are all no good and rotten.
For the democrats now to say - oh it was all because Bush was a liar - that is a deception and a lie.
THE REASON BUSH WAS ABLE TO GET AWAY WITH IT IS BECAUSE ALL THOSE PEOPLE KNEW BETTER - SHOULD HAVE DONE BETTER - AND WENT ALONG WITH IT FOR THEIR OWN SELF-INTEREST - THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SOLD OUT AMERICA.
YES THEY ARE THE ONES WHO SOLD OUT THIS COUNTRY.
IN LIFE, THE SELL-OUTS ARE THE ONES WHO TIP THE BALANCE.

I am a Democratic voter of over 20 years. I agree with the other poster. IF they do not count all votes in full by both FL and MI, I will dump the Democratic Party and vote for Independents. Obama is an OBAMINATION that has PUPOSELY thwarted democracy by stampeding ON voters rights in these states. OBAMA DISGUSTS ME. I am not concerned about Obama becoming President because this country will not elect a racist black man. Whites will vote just as racist as blacks do and there are far more whites than blacks. Bradley effect any one? What concerns me is the fools in the DNC, that would in concert with NObama, make the mistake of trampling on 2 million Democratic voters and think that this sits well with Democrats. ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?
Hillary Clinton run Independent. You will win.

Again... I am missing something.
Florida was controlled by the GOP and as usual... they determined when the general election was.
OBAMA AND CLINTON had a level playing field.
Both on the ballot.. BOTH could do no campaigning in that state. Popular and delegate vote should stand. And guess what..HUSSEIN could not BUY the votes by out spending Clinton.
MICHIGAN... that is a tough one.. Democrats controlled that state.
Both candidates WERE on the ballot. HUSSEIN took his name OFF the ballot??? Why we will never know.
Popular votes stands based on the votes for CLINTON... and good old 'crooked lawyer' Hussein gets the others.
NOTE that HUSSEIN is taking a low profile approach to the rest of the campaign. The less he says, the less likely hood that he will REVEAL the true Obama.
Keep VIPER WRIGHT, MICHELLE OBAMA and HUSSEIN off TV and he can coast.
Note two things in the news..
The new book about GOD BUSH's Administration.
Now McCain is constantly in the news..
MAIN STREAM MEDIA... is ATTACKING both of these guys... and letting their 'golden boy' hide in the wings.
Who says that KING OBAMA does not have a bunch of angels/despots looking over his shoulder... aiding him in his campaign.

If Barack Hussein Obama does not DEMAND that the Democratic National Committee seat ALL Florida delegates WITH FULL VOTES REPRESENTING THE RESULTS of the Florida Primary, then I will consider the Democratic Party FALSE to the IDEALS of the makers of America and will do EVERYTHING in my power to defeat Barack Hussein Obama and EVERY Democratic Party candidate from now until the Democratic Party is abolished and replaced by a political party with ideals akin to the ideals of true Americans. Please note that I have been a Democrat for forty years though I have ALWAYS voted according to my convictions.

I am a 49 year old woman who supported Hillary, until she start all the craziness. I knew Bill was a liar (remember Monica and the impeachment?), but I thought Hillary was stable. She's crazier than Bill. If she destroys this election for Barack, what makes her think that those who support him will forget and support her the next time. We like a team player not a destroyer...I'm sad to be a woman witnessing these women play the victim role. I'm a single parent, from rural Arkansas (yes, they were my governor and 1st Lady). I pulled myself from poverty through education, the military, hard work and prayer. I will not be defined by the likes of Hillary Rodham Clinton and no other self respecting woman should.

"DEMONIZING HILLARY: Every woman in this country should be outraged by the treatment Hillary Clinton has received as a presidential candidate. She is a victim of sexism, discrimination and media onslaught in proportions this country has never seen before. Male dominated media including some veteran journalists have lost all sense of fairness and balance when covering Hillary. They caricature her unfairly, quote her out of context, magnify her shortcomings, want her drop out of the race halfway through the race, belittle her lifelong service to this country, and ignore her service on behalf of children."
Yet, despite all these barriers to her getting the Democratic nomination, the general election would be smooth sailing because she is clearly the superior candidate, becuas eobviously sexism will be less of a problem in the general election than it will be in the Democratic primary.
More stellar Clinton logic for you...

I think all these are because of her gender. This makes one wonder how these seasoned politicians and payed spin doctors of the silver screen treat women in their own lives. Even some of the Democratic Party leaders who cried foul in 2000 with the Florida election fiasco are so eager to suppress millions of votes of Florida and Michigan to deny Hillary the nomination and to fix the election. That is hypocrisy. We should never allow this to happen in this country.

MICHIGAN,
Obama ran up to Michigan WITH LAWYERS IN TOW, when your state legilators were meeting to hold a new Primary. Obama wanted it STOPPED! He also NEVER had to take his name off your ballot! IT WAS AN OPTION! And inexperience! And a Primary!
HE does NOT want a new vote in Michigan!
He just wants to USE YOU NOW so he can get your vote in November!
DO NOT BUY INTO THIS!
He was not qualified during your Primary and he is NOT qualified now!
And what kind of a "Democrat" DOES NOT want to count every vote?
NOOBAMA!Not now and NOT in November!

"Beside the legal arguments, the political ones are important."
At least you're giving up on the legal arguments, realizing you have none...
I agree, there are political implications, which is exactly why Obama has shown willingness to compromise on the seating, and exactly why they will be seated, just not the way Clinton and her protesters will be militantly insisting.

"The Rules Committe should declare the original rule favoring Nevada and South Carolina over Michigan and Florida to be in violation of Voters' Rights of Equal Protection. The Rules Committee should further vote to state that the national party is bound to respect the Equal Protection of Voters in the primary election calendar no matter in which state they reside."
And national primary, here we come! Giving us a process that would put all power in the hands of the big states and urban areas, which is where candidates would focus their campaigns, as opposed to this election cycle where all 50 states got up close and personal views of the candidates and the candidates responded directly to their views for at least a 1 week period.
Your argument fails on several grounds. First, it presupposes going first is better (this campaign season has shown pretty clearly it is not); second, it disregards the well established traditions of the primary process; and third, it fatally misunderstands the equal protection clause, which again applies within a state, not between the states. There are numerous occasions both constitutionally and within federal law where citizens of different states are subject to unequal treatment (In the Electoral College, for instance, California gets 54 EVs for 36.5 million people, while Wyoming gets 3 for 515,000; so the votes of a citizen of Wyoming in the presidential race are worth 6 times as much as a Californian!), the 14th Amendment and the voting rights act guarantee the states must treat all of their people equally and the federal government, when viewing people as a whole, must treat them equally, but when things are subject to federalism, things are different. The parties had the authority to set that rule, and nobody's rights were violated in the process. If you don't like it, run for a seat on the DNC.

I've noticed this meme arising as well. At the very least, it flies in the face of Clinton's repeated promises to fully support the Democratic nominee. I suspect that such support will be paired with the "I told you so" strategy in order to position for 2012.
It's a shame. This is no doubt a difficult time for Clinton--but she can use it to turn away from such strategies, and devote this energy to even more strongly advocating for crucial Democratic issues in the soon-to-arrive general election. A difficult choice for her at this time--but the right one. One such issue, hot off the press, and a crucial Democratic wedge issue that will also cut against McCain's "service support" arguments:

I feel a 50/50 split is the only fair way in Florida. Since Obama's name was not on the ballot, many might have voted for Hillary that would have voted for Obama. We have no way of knowing.
Hillary voted the the DNC penalty and now wants that vote disregarded. So to make it fair, 50% of her votes in Michigan should be ignored and given to Obama. How can you vote one way and when you find it did not work the way you planned, vote another way? People have gotten to know and like Obama after seeing and hearing him. By not campaigning in Florida and Michigan, his message did not get heard. Split the votes 50/50 in Michigan and 60/40 in Florida where his name did appear. Any other decision would be unfair to Obama but this is fair to Clinton since his name wqas on the ballot in Florida. Either way, Obama still has the lead. The DNC needs to revamp the way it works in order to avoid a repeat down the road.
Michigan and Florida need to appeal to the DNC after the election in order to get their thoughts on the record. The rules they set for this election were alreeady voted on. Then the DNC needs to work out a plan like the Republicans have. Maybe we should all just vote Republican to get our point across.

wORTH REPOSTING..
Michigan in the house-
First of all, the lack of knowledge that most of you have concerning our state would be quite hilarious if it wasn't such a sad state of misinformation and idiocy. Please, come for a visit and really find out who we are - we could use the tourism - ha ha.
Now on to the question raised by 'bsimon'. Yes, most of Michigan is quite disgruntled with Dem. Gov. Granholm and, in turn, with the democrats. But we are also an educated, northern state with strong ties to the unions so, for the most part, the state is still a liberal state. As for whether the current Dems in our state govt. (who are the real ones to blame for this primary fiasco - not Obama) get re-elected....well, that is probably where the backlash will strike. Not in the general election.
As for those of you saying that Obama rejected a revote. Are you nuts? It was no revote - it was a setup by the Clinton party. You do realize that we have open primaries, right? And that means we can choose our ballot on the day of election without ever having to join a party or declare a party (a lovely idea). Well, since our incompetent state government (led by fierce Clinton supporters) screwed our primary and we were told our votes didn't count, how do you think that affected the results? Many people did not go to the polls, others crossed over and voted on the republican ticket - where their votes would count, and a full 40% of the Dem. vote count was uncommitted. That means thousands of people took time out of their day to come to the polls to vote 'anyone but Hillary' in an election that didn't count.
Now, fast forward to the revote suggested by Hillary. She wants a revote but only those who voted on the democratic ticket the first time! What? My dear friends, that is disenfranchisement! First we are told our votes don't count, then we are told that if we voted on the democratic ticket only, we can vote again. Don't you see how unfair this is? What it means is that all of the people who voted for Hillary the first time are welcome to come back to the polls and vote for her again. Everyone else who may have stayed home, crossed over or just went fishing that day are not allowed to participate. What???
Obama's denouncing that revote plan was the just decision for the electorate of Michigan. Everyone should be allowed to come to the polls and revote because that would be the only fair election. What is Hillary afraid of to have the entire state vote? Sounds to me like she is the one who is opposing a fair revote - not Obama.
So I end my long tirade by saying, "Please stop spouting such inane misinformation and threats." We here in Michigan can take care of ourselves. In fact, have you heard a large uproar from Michigan complaining of disenfranchisement? I haven't. So drop it and move on. We have.

To May 27 (or will you be May 28 tomorrow as you were May 26 yesterday?!):
Thank you for correcting me. But the US Congress also consists of two legislative bodies similar to the British form of parliamentary democracy, though correspondingly, the functions and powers of these two different form of legislative chambers may differ. I was only trying to emphasise that, unlike in a dictatorship or other form of authoritarian rule, in our system of democracy it is not uncommon for a candidate to woo the votes of people belonging to different ethnic groups. One must not read too much into it.
In your myopic view, anyone who speaks the inevitable truth has to be a member of the Obama campaign! I am no one's campaign mouthpiece. I was an ardent admirer of President Bill Clinton and I still am. Compare to the idiot that we have now in the White House, Bill is one of the best presidents we have had in recent history. Does that make me a person from the Clinton campaign? Get a grip of yourself man (or is it woman!) Goodness gracious me, who are you?
You also engage shamlessly in character assassination by claiming that Obama was
pretending to be a Law Professor. Can you quote one instance where he claimed that he was a Law Professor? He certainly was a senior Law Lecturer teaching constitutional law in the University of Chicago Law School. So, my friend, which part of that resume is whacky?
You were again wrong in saying that it was a fantasy of mine to assert that he helped hispanics find jobs. His service as community organizer was not restricted to the African Americans. He was a community organizer in some of Chicago's poorest communites that included the Hispanic community as well.
So don't try to give your two cents worth of cynicism with a heart filled with hate and prejudice. Be objective, fair and truthful in your comment.

I understand your potential objections - that somehow a primary vote cast in January is the same as one counted in June.
Well, we all know that is not true.
I understand that it may take one a minute to see that the national party should not be favoring Voters in one state over Voters in another state - however that is the demands of Equal Protection.
Perhaps some lottery system for the primary calendar would meet the demands of Equal Protection.
Perhaps a system of rotation among the states would meet the demands of Equal Protection.
A haphazard plan which evolved over decades perhaps might be subjected to Equal Protection scrutiny.
However, a national plan of a national party which deliberately seeks to favor the Voters of Nevada over the Voters of Michigan and Florida - that is subject to Equal Protection scrutiny.

It may appear curious to advocate that the Rules Committee declare the original rule UNCONSTITUTIONAL, thereby accepting a constitutional limitation upon itself however it is wise.
It is wise because we are all Americans who should uphold the Constitution and its principles without having a settled court case in front of us.
It is wise because it is the smart thing to do politically right now.
It is also wise to place the 2012 discussion on the right footing - all citizens in the United States are on equal footing.
We can not allow a situation to develop in which a bunch of Washington insiders sit in some obscure party committee meeting and decide which states' Voters have more influence on the process of selecting a President.
Or in this case, have a bunch of fat cats influenced by Harry Reid seek to place the political consultants of Nevada on the inside track to White House appointments, and the Voters of every other state could go jump in Lake Michigan.
As Americans, we follow Constitutional priniciples because we believe in them, not because we have a court saying we have to - the party is not really seeking to avoid a legal battle, but a floor fight which is worse.
The Rules Committee should recognize that Constitutional principles do play a role in the primary process and vote to bind the national party as such.
The Rules Committee perhaps never voted a restriction on itself - or the equivalent of a Marbury decision - however such a decision is appropriate and is the easiest way to solve this dispute which is clearly way out of control.

You need only to watch the video of her comments and demeanor to see that she was staying in the presidential race expecting something bad to happen to Obama.

I don't think it has sunk in yet, to the
DNC, the super delegates, and the media, that when the primary is "given" to the amateur Barak Hussien Obama, that the real power of the Democratic Party will emerge. Not just women, not just Hispanics, not just blue collar voters, (all of whom are being portrayed as second class citizens by the press and the talking heads), but every person who stands
for fairness, for excellence, for the BEST
person for the job of president(Hillary), will go the polls in Nov. and vote for John McCain.
I confess I will have to grit my teeth when I do it but I can assuage my crossing over by voting for all other Democratic candidates on the ballot. The Congress will
be solidly Democratic and McCain will not be able to pass anything that the Dems don't want passed. I'd rather see McCain in the White House, he is after all an American War Hero, than the "converted" Muslin(by his own words) and someone who has never served his country, except in the graft ridden politics of Chicago to aid him in his quest for power.(Gosh, the American Dream.) When Obama said Wright "converted" him into the Church of Christ I finally understood just where he was coming from. People who are "converted "are going from one religion to another, not to just join a Church, and the Muslim part that the media is so incensed about begins to make sense.
Hillary is the person who would put this country back on a path of prosperity, respect among ourselves and other countries. Its time the DNC, who for too long have wielded the power over the convention and the outcome of the election ,know that- we the people -are a force to reckon with and to be taken seriously, not as a joke among the pols and media, who seem to think the voting public is a silly little nuisance to be given lip service ,but in the end brushed off as no more than a minor irritation. We have a duty to select the person best able to represent all the American people, not to cave in to the media types who have led the parade to Obamania and who want to
tell us who the next President of USA should be.

These past five [5] days have been filled with "Analysis" of what Hillary said about the length of the campaign. The AP first reported {FALSELY} on the "Assination" of Bobby Kennedy in 1968, as somehow Hillary was staying in the nominating process expecting this to happen to Obama, then The Obama campaign was calling every News Orgination to continue the story, led by Mr. Axlerod and other supporters. This was done, and to their delight, it continues despite Bobby Jr.s statement about the incident and the family appreciating the concern Hillary has for Ted and the entire Kennedy family as most Americans have expressed. This is about as low as anything can get from his campaign.

The truth is that the democrats in Washington abandoned over the people of Michigan by voting for the Free Trade Deals.
The democrats in Washington took all sorts of campaign money from lobbyists and other interests pushing the Free Trade Deals.
Bill Clinton even last year was arranging lobbying contracts for his friends in Columbia, South America, even with his wife's campaign underway.
So, when it comes to Michigan - the Washington democrats who left the workers of Michigan high and dry do not want Michigan to have an influencial voice in the nomination process for President of the United States.
The Voters in Michigan might vote for someone who is against the Free Trade Deals or someone who wants to overturn the Free Trade Deals.
You see, Michigan the Washington insiders did this to you and they are now afraid that Michigan Voters will react - the democrats in Wasington don't want to hear from you again.
That is how they operate - the Washington insiders will do you in, and when you attempt to negotiate a proper deal, they will run from you.

Also, please check out the news reports today. Obama was in New Mexico attempting to gain support among hispanics.
Lastly, your assertions about Obama in the hispanic neighborhoods of Chicago is completely wrong - I really do not want to say that you are intentionally creating a deception. However Obama never worked in the hispanic neighborhoods - he worked in the black community and the projects - and ended up in a Black Liberation Theology church.
If you are from the Obama campaign, which I still suspect, your efforts to falsify Obama's resume are not a good idea.

Michigan in the house-
First of all, the lack of knowledge that most of you have concerning our state would be quite hilarious if it wasn't such a sad state of misinformation and idiocy. Please, come for a visit and really find out who we are - we could use the tourism - ha ha.
Now on to the question raised by 'bsimon'. Yes, most of Michigan is quite disgruntled with Dem. Gov. Granholm and, in turn, with the democrats. But we are also an educated, northern state with strong ties to the unions so, for the most part, the state is still a liberal state. As for whether the current Dems in our state govt. (who are the real ones to blame for this primary fiasco - not Obama) get re-elected....well, that is probably where the backlash will strike. Not in the general election.
As for those of you saying that Obama rejected a revote. Are you nuts? It was no revote - it was a setup by the Clinton party. You do realize that we have open primaries, right? And that means we can choose our ballot on the day of election without ever having to join a party or declare a party (a lovely idea). Well, since our incompetent state government (led by fierce Clinton supporters) screwed our primary and we were told our votes didn't count, how do you think that affected the results? Many people did not go to the polls, others crossed over and voted on the republican ticket - where their votes would count, and a full 40% of the Dem. vote count was uncommitted. That means thousands of people took time out of their day to come to the polls to vote 'anyone but Hillary' in an election that didn't count.
Now, fast forward to the revote suggested by Hillary. She wants a revote but only those who voted on the democratic ticket the first time! What? My dear friends, that is disenfranchisement! First we are told our votes don't count, then we are told that if we voted on the democratic ticket only, we can vote again. Don't you see how unfair this is? What it means is that all of the people who voted for Hillary the first time are welcome to come back to the polls and vote for her again. Everyone else who may have stayed home, crossed over or just went fishing that day are not allowed to participate. What???
Obama's denouncing that revote plan was the just decision for the electorate of Michigan. Everyone should be allowed to come to the polls and revote because that would be the only fair election. What is Hillary afraid of to have the entire state vote? Sounds to me like she is the one who is opposing a fair revote - not Obama.
So I end my long tirade by saying, "Please stop spouting such inane misinformation and threats." We here in Michigan can take care of ourselves. In fact, have you heard a large uproar from Michigan complaining of disenfranchisement? I haven't. So drop it and move on. We have.

This is hilarious actually, the outrage is all over the country.
The Credentials Committee has it next.
Obama would be wise to give Hillary all the delegates and attempt to become the nominee on that basis - the other path for Obama is horrible.
The worst scenario is Obama is still attempting to block Michigan delegates from being seated during a floor fight in late August.

Alan Sawye,
Are you really that stupid? Your rants make no sense. If you are mad, you should be mad at Obama who took his name off the ballot. How can Clinton steal your vote when Obama didn't offer you a choice to vote for him? Obama and Edwards supporters voted uncommited. Apparently you were not well informed.

Hello Sanchez (if that is your real name!), if everyone who stand by the truth and on the side of sanity and decency are
Obamaniacs, I'm proud to be one.
By the way, Santiago is my real surname. JI are the initials of my Christian and middle names. I am a Roman Catholic and I am proud of my heritage. So, Sanchez, be assured. I'm not some cowardly creature hiding in a pseudonym.
Your claim that this week the so-called Obamaniacs are attempting to appeal to hispanic voters is so preposterous. In so saying you are trying to infer that someone else has the sole right and claim to Hispanic voters.
May I remind you that in a parliamentary democracy, it is the inalienable right of every candidate to woo the voters of every race, color or creed, as long as they are Americans. Period! I don't see how only McCain or Hillary can claim sole right to Hispanic voters.
For your information, Obama spent much of his time in voluntary service on the south side of Chicago helping jobless and homeless Hispanics find jobs and shelters.
But he is not making that as a case for his right of claim for the Hispanic voters.
People vote for a candidate based on what he or she stands for and how best he or she serve them and their country. No voter of any particular ethnicity is the sole property of any one candidate. That, my friend, is the reality. Get it!

It may appear curious to advocate that the Rules Committee declare the original rule UNCONSTITUTIONAL, thereby accepting a constitutional limitation upon itself however it is wise.
It is wise because we are all Americans who should uphold the Constitution and its principles without having a settle court case in front of us.
It is wise because it is the smart thing to do politically right now.
It is also wise to place the 2012 discussion on the right footing - all citizens in the United States are on equal footing.
We can not allow a situation to develop in which a bunch of Washington insiders sit in some obscure party committee meeting and decide which states' Voters have more influence on the process of selecting a President.
Or in this case, have a bunch of fat cats influenced by Harry Reid seek to place the political consultants of Nevada on the inside track to White House appointments, and the Voters of every other state could go jump in Lake Michigan.
As Americans, we follow Constitutional priniciples because we believe in them, not because we have a court saying we have to - that is what we are seeking to avoid actually.
The Rules Committee should recognize that Constitutional principles do play a role in the primary process and vote to bind the national party as such.

Let's have no talk about Obama trying to steal the election. I'm an embittered Michigan voter. I voted in the Michigan primary by absentee ballot. I used the space clearly provided for write-in votes to vote for Barack Obama. Lo and behold, and after the fact, when the primary results were announced, it was also announced that write-in votes were not counted. MY VOTE WAS STOLEN AND IT WAS STOLEN BY THE CLINTON MYRMIDONS IN THE MICHIGAN DEMOCRATIC PARTY ORGANIZATION!!!!! I WILL NEVER VOTE FOR HILLARY CLINTON, EVEN IF SHE MANAGES TO STEAL THE PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION. She is no more worthy of my respect than Fidel Castro or Valerie Putin.

Obviously there is no specific case or there would be no discussion, right?
If you look up the cases, the courts have ruled that the national parties ARE not entirely private entities, they are subject to some CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES such as the protection of VOTING RIGHTS based on religion and race.
The position is that those CONSTITUTIONAL PRINCIPLES extend to EQUAL PROTECTION thus the national parties are bound respect the EQUAL PROTECTION OF THE VOTERS IN THE PRIMARIES.
I have heard your counterargument from others, that is one vote is one vote no matter when it is counted.
However, again, the very existence of the dispute proves that there is a material difference.
If there was no difference, and your position was correct, there would be no dispute and we would not even be talking about the subject.
So there is a material difference, there is a massive dispute, people are fighting over something that you claim is nothing.
So the existence of the fight disproves the point.

I remember that article when it came out about the Michigan compromise proposal.
All I have to say about that is
What about the voters??
So, let me get this straight, to appease Obama, the Michigan Democratic Party has agreed to change the election results?
Actually, the Michigan Democratic Party has decided to MAKE UP THEIR OWN ELECTION RESULTS.
If those "make-up" numbers reflected actual polling, then maybe those numbers could have some justification rooted in the desire of the Voters.

The series of postings from last week did include a discussion of precedents.
The courts have ruled that the national parties have a "right to exclude" based on opinions, such as issue differences.
However, the courts have also ruled that the national parties' "right to exclude" in the primaries does not extend to Constitutional protections such as race and religion.
As such, the national parties' "right to exclude" does not extend to the protect of Voting Rights and Equal Protection.
Hence, the original rule selecting Nevada and South Carolina over Michigan and Florida is unconstitutional.

You've posted a lengthy series of posts that do not acknowledge accepted precedent. Hence, Ickes and the campaigns (Obama, Clinton, etc.) support in August and earlier in 2007 of the DNC's right to sanction MI and FL. Primaries prior to 1984 had more and not less opaque regulations. Regardless, this is problematic and, in my opinion, is not best practice. That being said, it is hardly a violation of equal protection. This has already been decided in DiMaio v. DNC.
I agree, however, with your political insights regarding the necessity of appeasing the MI and FL delegations. Fortunately, the Clinton campaign is not supporting the MI delegations suggestion for seating their delegates: http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=20601103&sid=awDl.IEqNQFA&refer=us

To the poster at 10:37 PM
Obama IS ATTEMPTING TO STEAL THE ELECTION
LET US BE CLEAR.
First, he played this game by pretending to be the post-racial candidate and then he turned around and pushed race in South Carolina like no other Presidential candidate in recent memory.
Obama is attempting to STEAL THE ELECTION by pretending to be "offended" by comments by Bill Clinton, and then again by Gerry Ferraro - and others.
Obama was never offended by any of these comments - these are false charges.
Third, Obama is attempting to STEAL THIS ELECTION by playing the race card with the Superdelegates - again this is out of bounds and serves to divide this nation even more.
Obama is actually sacrificing the work of many people - white and black in recent decades - in order to run this kind of campaign.
It is a joke that Obama would try this.
Perhaps if Obama actually had a history of slavery and Jim Crow in his family, he would be more in touch with these issue.
However Obama does not have that family history, he is from an immigrant family who is basically carpetbagging on the Black Liberation Theology radical section of the Black community.
Obama IS ATTEMPTING TO STEAL THE ELECTION.

Don't the schools teach history anymore? Prior to the 20th century, virtually all nominees were selected by state caucuses, whose delegates consisted of state legislators--there were no elections where people voted directly for a candidate. The final candidate was selected at the party's national convention. This whole system was the direct result of a lack of safe and swift transportation.
By the latter part of the 19th century, the railroads allowed people to traverse the country in relative safety, and much more quickly than by horse. The telegraph also allowed news to go from point A to point B in an instant, rather than at 25 miles per hour. Slowly, the caucus system gave way to direct elections, but the final candidate selection was *still* done at the convention, itself. It wasn't until the 1960s that we started seeing the caucuses disappear and be replaced with primary elections.
The Constitution doesn't have a goddam thing to do with how either party selects candidates, so quit distorting the facts.

Let's have one thing clear - Obama is NOT trying to steal the election. He is LEADING. If anything, Clinton is looking for a way to steal the nomination. It shows how desperate Clinton supporters are getting that they feel that it's Obama trying to steal an election that they think was Hillary's by right! Obama has run a good campaign and ignored the constant Clinton attacks, picked up grass roots support and money from small donors, and put a message forward to the voters, who have given him the clear delegate lead, as well as the popular vote if you count ALL THE VOTES, INCLUDING CAUCUSES. I know that Clinton supporters are reality-averse, but it takes an incredible disconnect from both reality and common sense to suggest that Obama is trying to steal the nomination. You should blame those VOTERS who didn't go and do what you kept telling them to and voted for Barack Obama. It's the VOTERS who are stealing the nomination from Hillary!

The states control the primary elections. Public funds are used, therefore Constitutional Protections must apply.
You can say the national parties are wholly private entities, however that is not entirely true.
If the national democratic party wanted to run its own primary and pay for it, so be it, however the national party insisted on other people paying for the primary.
That kicked in certain Constitutional provisions, like Equal Protection.
I tend to doubt the national parties, given their integral role in the election of the President, are wholly private entities in any event. They are performing a Constitutional function in a Constitutional Process. Equal Protection applies.
Please check out previous postings.

I guess you quit the discussion before because you got pounded.
Beside the legal arguments, the political ones are important.
Specifically, Obama is better off supporting the seating of the entire delegates of Michigan and Florida.
Obama is better off on two counts.
One, he takes the issue from Hillary, and cuts off an avenue for her to go to the Convention, which is the worse case scenario for Obama. Second, Obama can begin to save himself from his stupid move of seeking to prevent the revote in Michigan.
Michigan is important for Obama.
So CLEARLY the endorsement of the superdelegates Obama has received over the past few weeks may have given him a cushion enough - Obama made a massive mistake seeking to stop the re-votes and he can only hope to save himself.

Several points:
1. The machinations of primary races are not delineated in the Constitution. The political parties determine their nomination processes. While the DNC might have made a mistake in punishing FL and MI too harshly (I think they did), they certainly had the "right" to do so.
2. Michigan is currently polling FOR Obama. Real clear politics has very convincing evidence.
3. Clinton's supporters would be crazy to vote for McCain IF they actually support the Senator's positions. McCain is very far from HRC almost across the board. McCain is anti-choice, anti-health, pro-rich, and now supports aggressive xenophobic immigration policies.
Please don't choose to ruin this country by supporting McCain because Mark Penn had a goofy political strategy and lost the race for HRC.

Obama is attempting to steal this election by holding Michigan and Florida off the books - and by racebaiting the Superdelegates with racial motivations to support Obama.
Come on people - are you all adults or are you just fooling yourselves???
The truth of this race has been stark - Obama is guilty of the MOST UNDEMOCRATIC ACTS IN MICHIGAN AND FLORIDA.
Obama's soviet-style tactics to PREVENT elections were very much like the Soviet Union's efforts to delay elections in Eastern Europe until he could secure his position.

I stand by my earlier barb that Van Hollen should concentrate on His Own Hypocrisy and hope that too many democrats do not realize that although the Congressional democrats were handed the majority - they have failed to stop the funding for the war.
What is wrong with them??
Apparently that is what the Congressional democrats were elected to do - except when they took some more overnight polls, they found out that perhaps they should have cold feet.
NOW which is it?

I supposed your position rests on the idea that the national parties have authority over the states - I dispute that idea.
If you look at the sequence of events here - the parties do not have authority - and they are seeking compliance through means which are unprecedented in American history.

Some people work nights - they can't get off for a few hours without missing an entire day's work - that is not right - it is much easier to vote in a voting booth on a break or on the way to work.
You should have respect for people who can not afford to miss work.
In addition, some people have child care responsibilities - a few hours at a caucus means paying for a babysitter.

I don't understand how anyone can blame Obama for the current malaise caused by the debacle in Florida and Michigan.
It was not Obama who pushed the primaries in both the states forward in defiance of the party rules. It wasn't Obama who ruled that the results of those primaries won't count. It was the DNC who made those decision to punish the defiance of the two rouge states. All presidential candidates, including Senator Hillary Clinton accepted the DNC rule and pledged to abide by it.
Now her recalcitrant behaviour smacks nothing more than selfish indulgence! Why? She desperately needs the invalid votes of the two states to make up her deficiency in the delegate as well as popular vote count.
Now, Hillary in her twisted mind comes out with another outrageous demand: Obama's caucus victories should not count!! So wicked and vicious is this deranged woman, that if she doesn't get the nomination she will leave no stone unturned to make sure Obama doesn't win the election.
But, you know what; little does she realise that she is treading a path not only to self-destruction but also to obliviousness of the Clinton legacy, which, by the way, isn't as bad as some might make out to be, barring Hillary's pugnacius, racist polarising campaign!!

The fact that the Obama campaign acted to prevent the re-votes in Michigan and Florida is a violation of DNC rules - the Obama campaign acted to prevent those two states from complying with the rules.
There must be a penalty assessed against the Obama campaign for playing politics with democracy.
The Voters are the ones who did not break the rules - apparently you are comfortable leaving the Voters out of the process which is an integral part of electing the President.
If the DNC was so intent on a different date, it should have paid for its own re-votes and made sure they happened.
At this point, we are left with only one vote and the Voters of those two states have to count someway.

Curious Constitutional Argument which the Obama people are attempting to defend
The national parties are essentially private entities which are free to:
1) Dictate to the States when and how to hold their elections
2) Remember other state offices are usually on the primary ballots - so the expenditure of funds for primaries usually is for an entire list of offices
3) The national parties, as private entities, can somehow intimidate Presidential candidates from exercising free speech rights to certain states which comply with the rules of the private entity.
4) This is why pledges are required.
5) The officials of states which were selected by the national party to go first somehow contributed to this intimidation by stating that if the Presidential candidates did not go along with the plans, there would be some penalty or retaliation in the states that were selected.
Curious how democracy is to be run now.

"Why is it such a bad thing to give a vote only to those people who are willing to actively participate by sacrificing an hour or two of their time to debate the merits of the candidates with their neighbors?"
The major problem with this is that it is not how the general election works. Yeah, the more informed and motivated people will probably pick the best president, but might not pick the one who is the most electable.
That's the argument that Clinton is making. While it is definitely self-serving and disingenuous, that doesn't mean its wrong and I definitely don't think the rules should be changed. Clinton should probably be calling for revotes in them if she truly wanted all50 states to count in her absurd popular vote scenario.
That being said, if the Democrats did away with caucuses, I wouldn't complain.

Hey 37th & O:
Fellow Hoyas know the address... but thankfully some of us are smarter than you are.
You want someone to blame? Blame the state parties for disenfranchising the voters of their states by breaking very concrete, published, widespread rules. They chose to ignore them. Now they pay the consequences.
I understand that being a hardcore Clinton supporter (as you obviously seem to be), it's a difficult pill to swallow when your candidate doesn't win the nomination. I get it... but look at Clinton's remarks last fall where she said that Michigan and Florida don't count. They broke the rules. Their delegates won't be seated. All of a sudden, she needs the numbers to work in her favor and she's done a 180 on her position. Not uncommon.
If you're looking for someone to blame about the Clinton sinking ship, blame the Clintons; if you're looking for someone to blame about Michigan and Florida, blame local officials for their inability (or refusal) to understand the clear rules. If you're looking for someone to yell at, try the mirror. I'm guessing that's the only person that would care to listen.

What a mess. Obama had NOTHING to do with Michigan being stripped of its delegates. He played by the rules and refused to campaign there. Now suddenly it's his responsibility and his burden to assuage the feelings of disgruntled MI voters who voted for Hillary?
Where are the DNC leaders? They should be on the front lines, accepting responsibility for this mess and vowing to make amends, not Obama. It wasn't his fault.
And for the record, the following is what Hillary wants from the Rules Committee: 1) don't count the caucus states Obama won, 2)count FL, 3) count MI but do not give Obama the uncommitted votes, and 4) seat all the delegates at full vote. If Hillary does not get EVERYTHING she wants, she's taking her fight to the convention. She is not prepared to compromise, and she is not prepared to help the Democratic nominee until the last possible second when it will be too late.

As someone from a caucus state, I must say that I'm getting pretty pissed off by all the talk from the Clinton campaign and its supporters about of how the results from caucus states are somehow less legitimate than results from primary states.
Why is it such a bad thing to give a vote only to those people who are willing to actively participate by sacrificing an hour or two of their time to debate the merits of the candidates with their neighbors?
Given the utter lack of even the slightest disapproval of the caucus process before Clinton finished 3rd in IA, this line of argument is patently self-serving and offensive to those of us who have no other means of voting for our preferred candidate.

Why would any Michigan or Florida voters care if Obama thought their votes were important in the General Election? He did not think they were important enough when it came to deciding who was going to be the Dem nominee. Michigan could have had a revote that was totally paid for and Obama was to cowardly to allow it because he knew he would lose. Don't want NObama in the White House. Hillary or McCain, but NObama.

Unless Obama is coming to say that he has finally agreed to a Michigan and Florida revote, there is no need for any visit. He will all ready have 90-92% of the black votes and the remaining 8-10% plus Hillary supporters and the white Republican votes will go to McCain. We don't want NObama that was too cowardly to go along with a fair revote. He stole the nomination with his caucus states and states like NC that gave him an automatic (NON-RACIAL) 1/3% of the vote lead. (Then the MSM acted like it was a super unexpected major win) (What kind of a chance did Hillary have when 1/3 of the non-racist voters were committed to Obama?) Obama will be another weak Kerry in November and the Dems will be whining that the election was stolen, when in fact there were enough signs that he could not win. Wish Hillary would say screw the Dems and run as an independant like Joe Lieberman did. After the way the Dems have slandered and bad mouthed Bill Clinton's legacy the Dem party no longer deserves any loyalty. They tore apart one of the best presidents this country has had in years just to try to get Obama elected. They must really be planning some big chit with Obama. The Dems and the MSM need to start playing fair and the superdelegates need to keep in mind that over 17 MILLION Dems want Hillary for our next president.

With due respect for all this frothing, gnashing of teeth and other nonsense - about some miraculous recovery by a candidate who cannot possibly pull out a win in this primary - and the dire predictions of a certain defeat of the Democrat in November if we do not nominate one of the most distrusted candidates ever to run for national office -- there are a few other things that we need to be thinking about - including:
A continuing war in Iraq that has cost our nation more than 4,080 young kids killed and moreover, nearly 30,000 wounded grievously wounded. While we are witnessing a Republican candidate who claims all is going well in Iraq: we just have to stay the course - occupy the country like it was Korea - "Muslims will have to deal with it;"
That same continuing war in Iraq that is costing our treasury about 10-12 BILLION dollars each and every month with many other hidden costs - including the incalculable loss of our respect and honor in the world community;
An attenuated effort in Afghanistan - curtailed by the drain on our armed forces and treasury of an ill-conceived and hopelessly mismanaged effort in Iraq. AlQaeda is in the mountains between Pakistan and Afghanistan - Osama bin Muhammad bin 'Awad bin Laden is there...remember him?
A housing mortgage collapse that is driving down the value of all of our homes - for most of us our home is our greatest investment and we are losing money everyday;
And a credit market collapse that dwarfs the mortgage industry problems, and is threatening the very foundation of our capitalist society - here and among our allies.
Gasoline prices at the pump predicted to rise past $4.50 per gallon by the end of May - with our trucking industry on the verge of a national strike due to diesel fuel predicted to surpass $5.50 per gallon by mid-summer. Wonder what that will do to our economy?
Additionally, we see tens of thousands of workers losing their jobs every month while new jobs are not coming on line and the nation teetering on the edge of a very serious recession which will bring industry closures and hundreds of thousands of layoffs. 80,000 jobs lost in March and THREE AIRLINES declaring bankruptcy in one week.
And, you claim that McCain is going to win in November???
The Republicans are responsible for the mess this country is in. Yet, they are the ones on these discussion boards who want to talk about everything else. Let's face it - their leadership is terrified by the thought of Barack Obama becoming our President. Absolutely in a total panic! Silly Republicans! They are toast in November. They are holding the Bush legacy in their arms and it is ticking they do not like it.
November 2008 is going to be an electoral disaster for the Republican Party - thanks in the most part to the guidance of Dick Cheney, the ineptitude of Don Rumsfield, and the blind stubbornness of their "boss" - the Dunce of D.C.
Furthermore, take a moment and look around. Examine the total voter turnout in the 47 primary and caucus states who have cast ballots thus far. -- Notice anything?
I've noticed an overwhelming number of new voters and "recovered" voters rising from their "couches" and making the trek to the polls to cast a vote.
They are voting Democratic by more than a 2 to 1 majority.
Why?
"It's no mystery," said Rep. Thomas M. Davis III (R-Va.). "You have a very unhappy electorate, which is no surprise, with oil at $108 a barrel, stocks down a few thousand points, a war in Iraq with no end in sight and a president who is still very, very unpopular. He's just killed the Republican brand."
Well, the diehard "Bushies" chorus - "...just you wait for John McCain."
Well, "my friends" - the old Republican warrior has once again accepted the challenge to serve his country -- and he will throw himself on the "live grenade" of the George W. Bush legacy. And, as the vetting starts, he will be forced to explain some of the "dinosaur" skeletons hidden in his Arizona closet. Ask an Arizonan - any Arizonan.
So - to all the angry Bush apologists, desperate Hillary devotees and fatalistic McCain admirers watching this disaster slowly unfold before your eyes - you are now experiencing what we felt when the neo-cons duped the dope into invading Iraq.
We are going to have a Democrat in the White House and huge majorities of Democrats in both houses of the Congress. Huge majorities!
Obama will crush McCain in Michigan and Ohio and Pennsylvania and may beat him in Georgia and New Mexico. Democrats, Independents and many centrist Republicans have had it with any more Bush/McCain "policy fixes."
To those of you having a hard time keeping up - you had better take a deep breath and try to figure how you are going to survive the next 4 years -- because in your hearts, you KNOW this -- you are going to do it with Barack Obama in the Oval Office.

DCexpat -- In one way, you are right about the many differences among the electorate in Florida. North Florida is pretty much a southern state -- very conservative, but socially and religiously. The west coast of Florida has a lot of transplanted midwesterners, many of whom are conservative. Even the Democrats are somewhat conservative. Southeast Florida has a lot of transplanted New Yorkers and folks from New Jersey, in addition to the large Hispanic bloc. The older Cubans support the Republicans, but some of the younger ones are switching parties. I have read that the non-Cuban Latinos are trending Democratic. The large Jewish vote in south Florida has traditionally been Democratic, but I understand that some of them are worried about Senator Obama and may trebd Republican this year. Even though the state legislature is dominated by Republicans, I think the presidential election is up for grabs -- unless McCain chooses Crist as VP. It's going to be interesting.

I agree, a huge headwind for GOP makes Michigan pretty safe Dem territory this Nov.
I don't expect Mich has a real immigration problem, and they don't have enough people making real coin that a reduced spending/reduced taxes campaign will mean all that much.
Traditionally, the down-and-out will vote Dem (and their promises of free spending, healthcare, etc). Seems to me that Mich has more than their share of economic misery these days.

OBAMA CAN WIN. BUT NOT NOW. NOT THIS YEAR. BILL CLINTON HIMSELF SHOULD TAKE HIM ASIDE AND REALLY TELL HIM WHY.
If Obama makes it to the White House, he will be either co-opted or effectively destroyed by the entrenched forces on both sides of the political spectrum. Forget the merits of his argument for a moment; he simply cannot win because he's too new on the scene, too inexperienced, too outmatched by the intransigent realpolitik of the established order.
If he were smart, he would find a way to cede his campaign to a third candidate with whom his politics is compatible (such as Al Gore). Then he could put in his time and earn his executive stripes as VP and let the country get to really know him. As it is, much of the country feels as though they're being force-fed Obamamania, and they don't like the feel of coercion.
This talk on MSNBC today about Obama potentially choosing Hillary as his running mate, citing statements made by Obama in Florida this weekend, only makes Obama look weaker. The more he praises Hillary the more he reinforces the notion that he's a hopeless compromiser singing a single tune of "Kumbaya."
Mr. Obama, you are no Abraham Lincoln enlisting the aid of a cabinet of rivals -- not at this stage of the game, at least, despite what Doris Kearns Goodwin may say.
It does appear that Obama is something of a narcissist with a martyr complex. He needs a dose of "the audacity of maybe not now, but maybe later." Can't he see that the very forces that he seeks to lead simply will not accept his leadership at this time, at this stage of his very young career?
Bill Clinton should take Obama aside and schools him on the dangerous intrigues of national office and why it is impossible for Obama to succeed unless he takes a more calculated and circumloquitous path to the pinnacle of American power.
We're talking survival here. If Obama is to succeed, he first must preserve his political viability. That will be gone if he becomes the nominee and fails to make it all the way to the White House.
Obama is gifted, but extremely naive. He really thinks he can have it all after only three years on the national scene. He has a choice. He can become a historical footnote, yet another legendary dreamer who never made it to the mountaintop; or he can measure his steps on the path to power and delay his need for poltitical gratification until he can get it the old-fashioned way -- by paying his dues and earning it.

NORTH LAS VEGAS, Nev. (AP) - Barack Obama's campaign says the candidate made a mistake when he said a great uncle helped liberate the Nazi death camp at Auschwitz during World War II.
Obama said Monday that his uncle was among the first U.S. troops at Auschwitz. But Auschwitz was liberated by Soviet forces.
The campaign said Tuesday that he named the wrong camp. They said it was actually Buchenwald.
Aides said his grandmother's brother, Charlie Payne, helped liberate a Buchenwald sub-camp in April 1945 as part of the 89th Infantry Division.
Critics had been questioning Obama's original comment mentioning Auschwitz.

The polls are probably distorted by intra-Democratic resentment right now. In the heat of the Obama - Clinton endgame, a lot of Clinton partisans are probably polling as McCain voters.

He is still leading McCain in almost all national polls. This is McCain's zenith, and he is still losing.

2008: the stories
On the first day of 2008, at midnight, the Republic of Cyprus and the Republic of Malta , both small island states in the Mediterranean and former British colonies , adopted the euro as their official currency, less than four years after their accession to the European Union . Because Cyprus and Malta are in different time zones , Cyprus adopted the euro one hour before Malta did. In both countries the euro was welcomed with outdoor celebrations, including a fireworks display in the Maltese capital of Valletta .
Stock prices dropped sharply in Europe and Asia on January 21, with fears of economic problems in the United States causing some of the biggest single-day losses in recent years.
Although larger losses occurred later in the year, these falls were seen to be unusually large at the time.
February
NOAA storm report for February 5. Red dots indicate locations of Tornadoes
Tornadoes were reported across the southern United States, with some sources saying as many as 48 have died. At least 69 tornadoes were reported to have taken place in just two days, most of which took place on the same day as US citizens were voting in caucuses and primaries on a day known as super Tuesday.

It has been reported that the torch was extinguished, then put on a bus to keep it safe. The torch was extinguished one time by a Chinese official when the torch was in the hands of David Douillet, and one time due to technical problems.

Questions were raised on how thoroughly the staff of United States Senator and Presidential nominee John McCain had examined the background of his running mate, Governor Sarah Palin before announcing that he had selected her on August 29. McCain's advisers insisted that Palin was "thoroughly vetted," a process that would have included a review of all financial and legal records as well as a criminal background check.
The questions arose amid controversy that Palin's 17-year-old unmarried daughter Bristol was five months pregnant at the time and how Palin was possibly abusing her powers as Governor of Alaska in the "Troopergate" scandal. McCain was aware of Bristol Palin's pregnancy before he asked her mother to join him on the ticket and reportedly did not see the pregnancy as a detriment to Governor Palin's selection as the vice presidential candidate.
McCain had reportedly met Palin only twice before her selection, and had his first face-to-face interview with her on August 28. McCain offered Palin the vice presidential spot just moments after their meeting concluded. The two appeared at a campaign rally event the following morning in Dayton, Ohio .
A view of the LHC tunnel.
The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) that started preliminary experiments on September 10, 2008 in CERN, Geneva, and the planned International Linear Collider (ILC) will carry out a series of experiments in the future to validate the standard model of particle physics. The model predicts that Higgs boson particles gives mass to all fundamental particles and explains the existence of dark matter, or invisible matter in between galaxies.
The LHC is a 27 kilometer long circular high energy particle accelerator which took more than 20 years and USD $9 billion to build. In the next few weeks the machine will collide opposing beams of protons charged with approximately 7 TeV of energy resulting in cataclysmic conditions that will mimic the beginning of time, a re-creation of the Big Bang.
Almost 13,000 children in China have fallen sick in a wave of sickness caused by baby's milk contaminated with melamine. Most of the sickened children are infants two years or younger, and four children have died from the chemical so far.
In the milk incident, melamine was added to make the milk appear richer in protein. It caused an estimated 53,000 to become ill, mostly young children. The chemical can cause kidney stones and kidney failure.
The Chinese Health Ministry has stated that most of the tainted milk was produced by Shijiazhuang Sanlu Group Co.'s infant milk powder and have pulled several dairy products off the shelves of Chinese stores. Sanlu, Mengniu and Yili were among the largest brands recalled, and have been attempting to repair their damaged public image.

Major P.K. Tiwari, a military spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission, said the fighting "started early this morning and ended late this afternoon." Tiwari said it was not clear who had attacked first.

Election results
The 2008 Democratic presidential nominee, Senator Barack Obama of Illinois , 47, is projected to win at least 349 electoral votes, more than enough to clinch the Presidency of the United States . Obama is the first African American to be elected President in U.S. history. His Republican opponent, Arizona Senator John McCain , is projected to win at least 173 electoral votes. McCain has phoned Obama to concede the election. Obama officially became the President-elect when John McCain issued his concession speech shortly after 9:00 p.m. Mountain Time.
Scores of people have been killed, and many more wounded, in what appear to have been coordinated attacks by gunmen wielding automatic weapons and hand grenades. The attacks began around 10:30 p.m. IST in Mumbai, Maharashtra, India.
Police reports indicate at least 80 deaths and a further 900 injured. More conservative estimates place the death toll at 78 with over 200 injured. According to television reports, a little-known group calling itself the Deccan Mujahideen has claimed responsibility.
Sites of the attacks have been listed as the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus railway station, a hospital, a police station and at least three hotels, including Oberoi Trident and Taj Mahal Palace & Tower. The Marriott Hotel in Juhu has been attacked with gunfire, but details are sketchy. A restaurant, Leopold Cafe on Colaba Causeway was also attacked.

December 14: Iraqi journalist throws shoes at US president George Bush
Bush and al-Maliki shake hands during the press conference, following the signing of the Strategic Framework Agreement.
An Iraqi journalist for an Egyptian Newspaper named Muntazer al-Zaidi was tackled by authorities after he threw his shoes at United States president George W. Bush during a press conference on Sunday in Baghdad.
Before throwing his shoes at Bush, the reporter stood up and said, "This is a farewell kiss from the Iraqi people, dog!" The words were followed by the reporter's two shoes being thrown at Bush, who had to duck in order to avoid being hit with them.
In Arabic culture, hitting or throwing shoes at someone so the soles hit them is considered a great insult.
Israel has launched over 30 simultaneous missiles strikes on Hamas installations in Gaza City, causing heavy damage and claiming at least 220 lives. The attack was allegedly a retaliation against frequent Palestinian Qassam rocket and mortar fire on Israel's southern communities.
